Repo of scripts 

### news articles
Followed the tutorial [here](https://www.quantinsti.com/blog/sentiment-analysis-news-python/) on scraping newspaper articles and performing sentiment analysis. Made changes to use different set of dictionary and analysis tools.

Sentiment analysis using [VADER](http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/sentiment/vader.html) and a simple dictionary using a corpus of postive and negative words.

Corpus from: http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html

Sample script using [gTTs](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS) to convert text to sound and using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) to play the sound file.
