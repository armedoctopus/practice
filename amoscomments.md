singapore| dansbandsmannen| &gt; I do not think that you are willing to accept why Amos Yee has been hit with bail conditions, even when presented with valid reasons.   I do not consider his bail conditions to be reasonable. Anything that has followed is meaningless to discuss unless you can change my mind on that.  &gt;Civil disobedience is a moral concept, it has no legal significance. Moral or legal, to voluntarily suggest, and to pick an option (jail term in this case) means that one fully deserves the consequences. Amos Yee chose the jail term himself, who are you to judge his personal choice?   Are you daft, but I guess I should thank you for arguing my point. His actions are those of moral question at best. The legal outcome is of no conversely of no moral value. The inconsistent laws of Singapore made his consistent, juvenile and most importantly harmless behaviour dictated that he had to be jailed is of no moral value.  If a child, or other intellectually undeveloped individual decides a jail sentence is for them, should we accept their judgement? Do you agree with him that we should let kids decide when they are ready for sex with adults too?  Unlike you I don't think that because he got jailed it proofs that he deserved it. I've learned to not shut my eyes and trust that the state knows what best in all situations.  &gt;Where morals are concerned, I believe that, with a fair assessment of the situation, a majority of the Singapore residents would agree that Amos Yee was in the wrong. Morals are defined by the society, and this this case, Amos Yee's actions are wrong, both legally and morally.   They are not concerned anywhere as this is a question of free speech, and the morals are completely orthogonal to the values of the former.  If you look further than Singapore I think you will find that he gets more support in principle internationally than domestically. Do you want Singapore to be more like Canada or UAE?| 1| 2017-12-30 16:42:08
singapore| AmazingRW| Sorry, I do not think that you are willing to accept why Amos Yee has been hit with bail conditions, even when presented with valid reasons.   Civil disobedience is a moral concept, it has no legal significance. For taking the high position of "educating" others, it seems like you are urgently in need of some yourself.| 1| 2017-12-30 13:45:48

singapore| AmazingRW| &gt; You can think he's a complete jerk who didn't deserve jail time.  This is what many people are mistaken about. Amos Yee was not originally handled a jail term. He was handled a probation sentence. The only reason he was in jail is that his father refused to bail him out (and he broke the bail conditions multiple times). He asked for a jail term in order to backdate the duration he spent under arrest. Doing so would completely avoid the need for probation.  The jail term was a deliberate and calculated attempt at maximising his benefits. | 1| 2017-12-29 14:15:20

singapore| hotgarbagecomics| Not gonna lie, I had to look up what "strawman" meant.  The way I see it, the comic is specifically about Amos Yee supporters, and not the larger category of people who criticized the treatment meted out to him (which includes both supporters and detractors). I loosely modeled the 'supporters' characters on the HK activists who championed his cause in the early days of his arrest.| 1| 2017-12-29 09:59:15
singapore| BendystickCricketbat| &gt; I didn't imply it. I asserted it pretty clearly. You asserted that about the comic in question. My reply was picking on you extending your assertion to other comics out there, just like how you are accusing the comic of implying that all "that people who criticised the government's treatment of Amos Yee are his ardent supporters".   Don't like the comic? You do you, but at least don't be blind to your own hypocrisy, lol Have a good day| 1| 2017-12-29 09:47:08
singapore| mee_sua| Your mimicking doesn't make much sense here.  &gt; It implies that comics who criticised supporters of Amos Yee are saying that people who criticised the government's treatment of Amos Yee are his ardent supporters.  I didn't imply it. I asserted it pretty clearly.  &gt; That's clearly untrue, because you do not need to agree with the implied statement to enjoy a joke. You can think that it's simply a comic that doesn't need to be taken so seriously.  I stated my disagreement quite plainly. I am also free to give my criticisms, and am not obliged to find this comic funny at all.  | 1| 2017-12-29 09:04:30
singapore| anthonywhitetan| iirc amos yee was given a cease and desist order or face jail term. And instead of toning down he escalate the issue and choose the jail term.  I too agree that he was unfairly treated earlier on. But, sigh. He still is unrepentant...| 1| 2017-12-29 08:58:05

singapore| firewind555| Omitting a massive chunk of info(court drama and some of the other stuff he did), here is my attempt at summarizing.   Background: Amos Yee is a former child actor (though given recent events you might disagree) who is known for his controversial views in his videos and posts.   In 2015: Shortly after the death of Former PM Lee Kuan Yew, he uploaded a video filled with expletives painting LKY as a 'power-hungry dictator' and his followers as 'foolish and blind.' He likened the both to Christianity as well. This drew the attention and ire of many Singaporeans who were in mourning of LKY at the time. 32 police reports were made against him because of this. He was arrested after, and despite being 16, was tried as an adult and sentenced to jail for 4 weeks. This attracted the attention of international media, some who reported as is and some who supported Yee and attacked Singapore on its restriction of freedom of speech.    2016: Sentenced to jail for 6 weeks and fined $2000 after he did what was in the cartoon above. Jail time was at Tanah Merah, then home detention. Fled to US in Dec to seek asylum.   2017: Incarcerated in a US jail. Asylum granted in March but US gov appealed in April, so he was still held at Immigratuons and Customs. Asylum finally granted in September. Then you have his FB posts and here we are.| 1| 2017-12-29 08:47:32
singapore| mee_sua| This comic is a strawman.  It implies that people who criticised the government's treatment of Amos Yee are his ardent supporters.

Destiny| deathmetalzebra| I agree with you, but just to clarify, I'm not blaming Destiny for nailing down his opponents on a point, you have to do that in a debate, especially with such disingenuous opponents.   However, (I don't know if you remember this), when he was on that Amos Yee debate with Blaire White, early into the conversation they got in an argument about whether she edited the footage of her walk around Washington where she got beat up. She immediately started backpedalling and trying to avoid the question, to which Destiny simply said "Did you edit the footage, yes or no?", to which she was forced to respond straight up.  I liked that a lot, and I think that's a perfect example of calmly and coldly nailing down the disingenuity of your opponent, but in this debate Destiny seemed to take a lt more personal jabs and insults at the people, which I don't think is necessary when trying to nail down their inconsistencies.  | 1| 2017-12-29 03:13:48

TranscribersOfReddit| transcribot| Amos Yee   21 December at 15:55   I'm in love. I am so happy to have finally found a girl I love and who loves   me back. She is so beautiful   She's an American college student, few years older than me. Politically   far left, vegan. Loves music and art, reads every day. Very intellectual,   smart (her IQ is literally recorded over 150). Conventionally considered   fucking beautiful and hot. Super opinionated. Very pleasant, emotionally-   supportive, polite girl. She's a perv with me though which is such a turn   on. Absolute fucking beast in bed. She sneaked out when her parents   weren't noticing, met me in the room and made out and fucked me for   hours tearing away my virginity. It was one of the most magical moments   of my life   I asked her after we had sex, "Hi does that mean you're my girlfriend   now?" and she asked "Well... do you want to be my boyfriend?" and I was   like: "yeah" and she replied "So then... I'm your girlfriend now". She then   came over to hug and kiss me. She is so beautiful. I love her so much   And sure... I know that with every close relationship as you get to know   someone more and more, there will probably be disagreements and   arguments between us eventually, but that's completely fine. In fact, I   don't think I would love her as much if I thought she was perfect.   Disagreements and flaws are honestly very fascinating to me, it's what   makes us human and what I think better connects us to other human   beings. So I'm not only not fearful of the inevitable conflicts we'll have as   a couple, but I actually embrace it. I want to know her completely: all her   beauty and ugliness, all her interests and insecurities, and share all of her   happiness and problems. To now share a life with someone that is not   your own, it's such an adventure and I think it's going to be really exciting   and romantic. God I love her so much   Until yesterday, I had never even gotten a 1st kiss or had a single   relationship with anyone. I had been rejected by every girl with no   success at all for about 13 times (I'm literally not kidding). I knew that   both in my thoughts and behaviour, I'm really different from what a   typical person in society is and would love, and I was never willing to   change my behaviour unless I personally thought that trait of mine was   genuinely bad. I was never going to be less vulgar, be less political or   start putting goo on my hair because well... that isn't me, and there's   nothing wrong with that... but I knew it's going to be awhile before I find   someone that truly loves me. Which is why I'm so touched that finally...   'Just be yourself' actually worked, and after so long I finally found   someone who not only doesn't mind the quirks of my personality that   many people are turned off by, but actually enjoys them. Who genuinely   feels connected to me and loves me for who I really am. I am so happy I   found her. I'm so emotional just thinking about it   So...l did it friends, I finally found a girl that I love and who loves me back.   And I think.... life has become so much sweeter. I'm so happy right now,   this is one of the best things that's ever happened in my life. Just know,   no matter how weird, or different or strange you are, there will always be   someone out there that loves you, and I hope everyone finds that special   person     ---  v0.4.2 | This message was posted by a bot. | [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/index) | [Source](https://github.com/GrafeasGroup/tor) | Questions?

StarWars| TheGayslamicQueeran| I've got no problem with Bobby Lee, he's a wonderful actress, but the character Rose had a tendency to spell out any morals that were meant to be shown through her story arc. Like her lines when she freed that last racehorse alien how it was "the real victory" or something and when she crashed into Finn and said its "not about fighting what we hate but saving what we love." Like, I'm sure Amos Yee can do a good job if she reprises her role as Rose, but I think the character needs to be wrote a little better.| 1| 2017-12-24 17:42:36

The article was basically poking fun at the losers lamenting over “someone like Amos got gf but I still don’t have omg I sad siah:(“. The article actually made a terrific point too. Stop setting something as pathetically mundane as having a gf (or bf) as your minimum benchmark for being a worthwhile human being and maybe your existence will be less dreary. | 6| 2017-12-23 13:46:41
KotakuInAction| TimStrategos| It's not just Kraut acting like a prime douche.   His "Why I dislike the SJW community in YouTube" video, good video. But if you go through it point by point he matched every behaviour that he pointed out as malfiecent.   He's the German version of Vadim Newquist. Toward the end there he became nothing but a sceptic drama channel.   And you know what? Newquist might have gone and shit on everyone who tried to give him a fair shake, might have gone out of his way to misrepresent his """""culture warrior""""" opponents, but at least to my knowledge he never stooped to Krauts level and started going after peoples employers or trying to find their personal details.   I dislike too, how this drama has somehow come back to Sargon. All evidence suggests Sargon was telling Kraut to just do his videos. This Coach Cuck Pill guy is litetally just making shit up for attention and it's fucking absurd that he's being given as much attention as he is.   This "Skeptic(patent pending) not-a-community-but-acts-like-a-community" ...thing. Shit like this was inevitable. Opportunists like Spino, Kraut, Vadim Newquist, Cuck Redpill. They'd all show up eventually in some form or another. A bunch of autistic shitflingets who do naught more than identify people they don't want in their secret political discussion clubhouse that is YouTube and do everything in their power to discredit and smear them, ultimately smearing themselves in the process. I cannot begin to tell you how many times this happened on YouTube, if it can happen to Minecraft streamers and Transformers reviewers it can sure as shit happen to political commentary. I'm just surprised nobodys been called a paedophile yet. Probably because the Amos Yee memes are still fresh and spicy.  It'll blow over, it unironically is just like high school. The people starting the shit, telling the lies? They'll all be mocked into irrelevance because all the evidence they can produce will be so thin a blind man could see right through it.   I'm also fairly surprised that I hear the Drunken Peasants were on Krauts little shitlist. What were they even doing to earn his scorn? They had JF on a couple times to joke about videos and have a rap battle against an autistic special needs fan. That's all I can remember.| 3| 2017-12-23 07:54:01

LivestreamFail| BrancoXIII| Okay, just let me preface this with that I believe our opinions are not that at odds with each other and most of the pedophilia thing is just a simple misunderstanding.  So afaik, he first had the Amos Yee debates where, yes, his position was a child cannot give informed consent. Then later, he had his very own chain of pedophilia debates where his position explicitly was "it might helpful to make CP available to potential offenders in a therapeutic setting." Queue 2-3 debates with some no-name viewers or discord dwellers. And claim about his lack of knowledge is not limited to these pedophilia debates, just to clear things up.  To expand on the Sargon debate (it was the second and last one). "blacks need to get married" in itself is not that bad a claim and there is statistical correlation. Destiny suspected there must be a more underlying reason than just this and got really agitated when Sargon said he doesnt know but he doesnt know either. That's it, insert his circlejerky community that memefies Sargon phrase as if its wrong and you get people who think Sargon is off his rockers who havent even seen the debate.  The "slavery was a net growth of the economy" thing derives from the economics part of the discussion where Destiny presented his utopic plan of unregulated mass migration because it grows the economy (not wrong). Sargons criticism of destiny's idea in the economics part of the discussion was a moral criticism.  My point generally is the Sargon debate was in itself a very good debate because neither Destiny nor Sargon were well versed, they were on the same page concerning economics, for example, and Destiny eventually lost his temper. What irks me is the bad wrap Sargon gets nowadays because Destiny obviously holds a grudge and his community just goes along with it.  Even if you dont care who wins compare this debate back then with any other he has been having lately: the niveau dropped exponentially. | 1| 2017-12-16 23:42:28

Destiny| BoozeoisPig| It gets better with more objective information, but even without enough objective information, it is the only theory that actually makes sense. And it isn't even "A" theory, there are multiple different kinds of ways to categorize the value of utility. There is total vs. average utilitarianism. Total utilitarianism is basically: We should seek to maximise the total amount of utility in the universe.  Average utilitarianism which is what mine is which is basically: We should seek to maximise the total amount of utility that can be experienced by all things that are alive.  The first one demands that we should probably reproduce for the sake of reproduction, simply because the utility of each new person is a good thing. The second one only concerns people who are already alive and says that any new person who is created must be considered as a potential means to an end more than an end in and of themselves, because before you create a new person you have a greater opportunity to think about how they will fit into society and consider if that is worth what you will have to give to them.  There is most utilitarianism which is morally realist which basically says: Goodness exists and it is happiness, and evilness exists and it is suffering. I am a non-cognitivist regarding objective morality because I don't understand what it even means to say that moral facts to exist independently of minds. To that end I am a moral anti-realist, which is apparently very rare for utilitarians, but it is still possible.  Then there is utilitarianism which is merely based on maximising "pleasure" and there is preference utilitarianism which is what I adhere to, which is the maximisation of the fulfilment of your preferences.  But what makes deontological and virtue ethics unviable is a combination of objective morality non-cognitivism (it doesn't even make sense to say that there are universal maxims or states of virtue that "exist" as things we should adhere to), and the fact that  deontology necessarily requires an appeal to consequences in its meta-ethics. If you ask someone "why should we adhere to these particular maxims or these particular notions of virtue?" they will have to appeal to consequences to justify themselves, to other people, and the whole reason that they took on the the theory in the first place are because of the consequences they would believe would occur if they didn't. And those consequences take the form of 2 things: 1: The notion that society would not function as well if we did not adhere to that moral theory, which itself begs the question by what standard would society function better than if not under greater utility? 2: The discomfort one would feel should they have to accept the validity of utilitarianism in some situation. And I agree, utilitarianism has some very uncomfortable implications. But uncomfortable does not necessarily equal incorrect. Like I said, there are many things we would say would be awesome if we did them or someone else did them, but they are hard as fuck, so we don't do them. And whether we ought to change ourselves so that we can do those things or accept our limitations is what politics and progress is all about.  That's where "utilitarian iconoclasm" comes in. Take Amos Yee, who is actually a great example. You could argue that Amos Yee, in Singapore, when he spoke out against the government, was actually doing the wrong thing, because he sowed discord in society that causes a great deal of discomfort. But Amos would probably say: Well, that shit would be worth it because the discomfort now is payed off many times over once we actually can criticise the government openly, society will become a better place, because then people will not feel nearly as much anxiety about the potential consequences they might experience, and that it is better to allow everyone to speak out against the government so that they can criticise it when it starts to become too shitty, than to prohibit anti-government speech, because even if the government is good now, they might be bad in the future, and a good government will withstand criticism against it in a free society.    Amos Yee might also be engaging in utilitarian iconoclasm when he advocates for abolishing or at least massively relaxing age of consent laws, because it might just very well be that children are experiencing the level of sexual anxiety that they do now not because they are just naturally afraid of sex, but because we instill memes of sexual shame in children from such an early age that they can't help but feel ashamed if and when they are abused and then have to grow up constantly being fed the message that they were fucked up.  Personally, I suspect that children and most people are naturally uncomfortable about sex to at least a mild degree, because we evolved to be sexually competitive beings, and in order for our bodies to facilitate that competition, they have to make us uncomfortable about sex. But I do sympathize with the idea that a whole bunch of the discomfort is only there for everyone because of memes of sexual shame that were created and perpetuated by leaders who wanted more control over the sexuality of those whom they controlled since it would allow for more ease in arranging marriages.| 1| 2017-12-16 11:17:58

AskReddit| Unusualist| General consensus about Amos Yee from us is that his opinions were inappropriate in our heterogenous society which cherishes our hard-earned multiracial tolerance. As a young nation in the 20th century, Singapore faced several racial riots and had hoped to prevent such conflicts. Let's not discuss about Singapore's stance on free speech here.  Instead, I am curious, now that he has gone to the United States, what are the general opinions of him?   My personal opinion - can't be bothered about his opinions, although I find them insensitive. Not too bothered whether had he been rightfully or wrongly charged in court in Singapore.   What about yours? Where does he stand in your eyes, now that he was granted asylum in the US? Is he a clown?| 1| 2017-12-13 21:43:12

Destiny| Bluezephr| So, I see a lot of people saying this, but this was absolutely in context. The context is explicitly stated by destiny before he answers.  His position isn't being misrepresented, the only thing that's omitted is an incorrect answer to the hypothetical dilemma. This isn't quote mining, or misrepresenting him.   &gt;The amount of people who take Destiny out of context like it's their job is astounding.  I agree. Do you actually not see the difference between these two things?  &gt;Destiny raises a hypotethical and the cave man lets Destiny know  &gt;"I don't like arguing hypotethicals ... it's kind of a leading question. It results in me giving you the answer you like."  So, arguably this makes him look worse. Yes, this is a hypothetical with a purpose. Destiny is trying to prove a point. Unless you're stupid(probably), or dishonest(probably not), you should have no problem answering these hypotheticals.   &gt;You didn't give the cave man a chance to expand on his point.  He expanded on it for like 20 minute before, saying that we need to use vigilante justice and castrate pedophiles as a deterrent. If you could condense his elaboration down to a clip, it would honestly look worse.  &gt;You forced the conversation to close.   At this point, there are two possibilities I can see. One, he's being serious, in which case this is a person who's ethical and moral values are extremely abhorrent, moreso than any alt-right race realist. OR he's at this point being so dishonest, stressed out, or stupid that he can't even concede a pretty clear point.  Neither of these people are worth talking too. You could argue that if he had the capacity to examine ethical problems in the way that Amos Yee did, that then it would be worth having the discussion, but this guy wasn't equipped to discuss his potentailly abhorrent view. There's nothing that could be gained by letting him expand.  &gt;Even if it was almost certainly going to be followed up with more shit spewing on his keyboard, at least Destiny would have given him a chance and can then claim the clip was not out of context.  But that's the thing. If someone tries to find the context, they'll hear him advocate for vigilante justice, human rights abuses, and still come away with the context of the clip. Sure, destiny looks more triggered, but honestly, it's probably fair for him to be triggered at this point.  &gt;On a side note, this is the first instance to me of Destiny giving the alt-retards real ammo.  This will give them far less ammo than the out of context clips they already take. If they defend this idiot, they'll only look bad.  &gt;They are already extremely weary of their inability to engage in any non-emotional discussion, and when Destiny gives them this kind of treatment it validates all of their insane suspicions about lack of fair play and "GOTCHA" moments.  But this is kind of a good thing then. If they're seen as too scared to defend their views, the optics benefit Destiny. If the middle ground people think destiny is being unfair, then yeah, that's a problem. However, if the alt right feels scared to debate him because they'll be trapped into admitting abhorrent shit, then good. They'll look bad because of it. How many of Ians fans are having their doubts because of his fear to debate Destiny. How many of the alt-right people who value supremacy see Millennial woe's fear of debate as being "beta". Not being able to stand up to someone looks bad for them, and sows doubt into their communities, and furthermore, we get to rub that in.   In summary, you're being too sensitive. If this clip actually misrepresented this guy, then yeah, I'd agree with you, otherwise, this kind of shit is what we need more of on the left. | 1| 2017-12-12 04:08:24
Destiny| Mr-Miracle| 100% this. I'm a graduate student in clinical counseling and while I'm not an expert on addiction by any means (My background is CBT), there has been so little research on pedophilia, it's hard to say how it best should be treated. To be honest, this vague treatment plan that has been proposed in a single study sounds dumb; would it stop potential child sexual assault? Maybe. Would you be able to treat pedophiles? I doubt it. If someone can explain to me, in more complex terms, what therapy would look like, then I'll take back my statement. But this vague "We'll just give them CP and therapy at the same time in a clinical setting" sounds dumb as fuck.   Are they going to be doing weekly masturbating sessions before they check-in with the therapist or after? What's the theoretical background of the therapist? When they come in to jack it weekly, will the therapist be gradually minimizing their time with the CP or making the CP they provide older without their knowledge? I don't really care about any of the ethics behind it and I'm being tongue and cheek, but that's only because I think this treatment plan sounds extremely stupid and I can't even begin to imagine how it would possibly look in real life because no therapist is going to tell a pedophile to stop looking at CP. They're just going to explore the thought process and emotions behind it. You want to know why pedophiles look at CP? I have a guess, even though I haven't met one. It feels good to jack off.   I can't wait to see an automatic thought record regarding looking at CP:  Situation: I wanted to look at CP.  Emotion: Horny. Automatic Thought: I need to jack off, because I am turned on.  Behavior: Masturbated.   Therapist: So, do you see any cognitive distortions here?  Pedophile: Nope.  In my opinion, this whole thing is about whether one wants to treat the cause vs. the symptoms. Benzodiazpines are a "success story" for anxiety, but they're rarely prescribed anymore because all they do is cover up symptoms and lead to addiction. Furthermore, they're detrimental to therapy and, as a result, the cause of the individual's anxiety is never addressed.   Not a whole lot of research has been done into pedophilia due to ethics and its taboo nature. There aren't a whole lot of pedophiles out there with an attitude like Amos Yee volunteering for clinical trials. However, committing sexual assault on a child would be a symptom of being pedophile, unless we're talking about treating child sex offenders. Do we want to stop that from happening? Sure. However, we have absolutely no idea how many pedophiles exist, and from what percentage of those actually go on to take part in that behavior. Formulating an entire treatment plan for a society based on this premise is a flawed approach -- unless one doesn't care about treating pedophiles and cares more about just stopping child sexual assault. A treatment plan should address treating the actual cause of the pedophilia, if that's even possible, which we don't know yet unfortunately. | 1| 2017-12-12 01:07:50

Is he a pseudo-intellectual based solely on the fact that he speaks fast? The content seems fairly reasonable, whether you disagree or not, he tends to work around studies and facts and tries to avoid anecdotes etc. So assuming this is true, the only reason people call him pseudo-intellectual is because he speaks too fast. Or am I wrong?  &gt; "Speak softly and carry a big stick"  He pretty much does this with the skeptic/amos yee debate  Btw, Lily *very* obviously enjoys this kind of humour.

'Rights' is just a human concept and reeks 'entitlement'  yes and there is also freedom in being safe, freedom to walk on the streets at night. you are right that a balance between the two needs to be struck and i only think that what happened with amos yee was well within that balance.  &gt; It's easier because we are a small country.  i would disagree. the international community respects singapores stance on limiting foreign influence because we have shown ourselves to be responsibly governed. once that is gone the government is opening themselves up to foreign interference and providing a pretext for others to undermine their rule. the 'big brother' scenario you fear is not a sustainable path for any government of a country this small, especially in this region.  compare this to some of the oil-producing middle eastern countries that enjoy open trade and political independence despite being accused of having some of the worst human rights records. singapore doesnt have that privilege.| 1| 2017-12-05 14:58:58

DebateCommunism| yaeyaeyaeyae| Heyo, Singaporean here! While it is true that many important services such as healthcare (looking at you USA) and housing (due to the immense lack of land) are state owned, the government plays almost no part in our economic activities. Income tax in Singapore is very low and businesses are very free to conduct business as they please. While it could be argued that Singapore is a pseudo- one party state and that Singaporeans are not *politically* free (search up Amos Yee, a teenage political dissenter sent to jail), Singapore is, for all intents and purposes, very economically free. Of course, as it was previously mentioned, correlation is not causation, but yeah if anything Singapore is very economically free.  Feel free to ask any Singapore related questions!| 1| 2017-12-05 11:10:54
singapore| CharAznia| First off U are taking a very narrow approach to all this. Just because this particular protest did not inconvenience anyone does not mean future ones won't. I've experienced entire metro system in Paris not running for days. My excursion to the Palace of Vasillies never happened because the staff decided to go on strike that day. I've many colleagues in London who had to spend all their annual leave at home taking care of kids because the teachers when on strike. I've been stuck in traffic for 4 hrs for a journey that should have lasted 45min because some clowns decided to hold their protest on the roads around the main plaza in Lima, Peru. That's just some of the things I've personally experienced, funny part is a lot of my foreign colleagues would love to have what we have here. Confining protest at a single location to minimize disruption  2nd, I said laws are subjective however I did not say ALL of them are inappropriate for everyone. Just because some liberal rules work for the majority does not mean it works everywhere. The same liberal democracies that work so well in Europe failed miserably when imported into the middle east and Africa, not only did it not makes things better, it made things way worse. Implementation of laws and policy needs to take into account local culture and practices. We may disagree with the dictatorship like rulers in the middle east but those same dictators were keeping the terrorist in check. I'm not saying they should stay dictatorship forever however the region is simply not ready for it and it should not have been forced upon them.   Closer to home, I am of the view that LGBT's much hated section 377a should be repealed. I am also in agreement with the govt that society at large isn't ready. Some things simply needs time to be resolved. I'm not saying we should ignore everything from the West, I'm saying we need to only learn from those that suits us.   Ur definition of progressive is extremely narrow. Ur idea of progressive is we have to follow the liberal west, the problem is you guys idea of the freedom enjoyed by the west is just as much an illusion. There are many things that is banned or illegal in the west which is totally against basic human rights but totally ok in SG. E.g. France ban wearing of the burqu. Or how about selective free speech, where promoting of Nazism is banned in Germany. U might also want to read this as well https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/france-begins-jailing-people-ironic-comments So why is it never mentioned and totally OK when they do it but when SG does it. OMFG human rights pitch forks out. The "Free Speech" that clowns like Amos Yee and Roy Ngerng promotes does not actually exist anywhere in the world  Third, it was an example, u are not suppose to take it literally. Let me make another example that might be more valid. Taking drugs like Heroin is illegal here. I disagree with the law. Does it mean I can start taking heroin? My point is just because U disagree with the law does not mean U are allowed to break it  Finally, 3 words. Graduate Mother Scheme. There are many more, that is the most famous one that even U should probably have heard of| 1| 2017-12-05 09:16:38
Destiny| Pwoner7000| Don't really want to comment much on his stance about pedophilia because I don't think a healthy open dialog will ever exist with him and others cause Amos likes to tailor definitions of words and phrases to fit his stance and others (mainly the septic sphere) just want to use emotionally charged words every time they talk to him because they know he is wrong, but they can't argue why he is wrong   Amos Yee is just an edgy dude and that's how he got his fame.(look him up on Wikipedia and you will see the edgy shit he has done.) While this subject is something to have a good conversation about, Amos is not the right person to champion it mainly because of his past and how passionate (if thats the best word to describe it.) He is about this. I wonder if the septic community would be more open to this if someone like sargon or Richard Spencer came out with this idea.| 1| 2017-12-05 06:07:51
Destiny| Decht| Oh, that's interesting. I wonder why it didn't stick for Destiny? That might explain why practically no one is bringing it up after the Amos Yee debates, though.

Destiny| salsacaljente| Few weeks ago destiny had a guy on who did a really good defence on utilitarianism. his basic argument was that deep down everyone is a consequentialist. what people disagreeing on is the weight or implication of specific acts. If deontology or kant's categorical imperative would produce consistently bad outcomes nobody would talk about those. and destiny mostly agreed and i think he almost called himself a consequentialist after this. But during the amos yee debate he kinda switched his position ignoring everything just to win the stupid debate bringing up all the  strawman arguments against utilitarianism.| 1| 2017-12-05 05:49:31

Destiny| Mysfwaccount93| Oh yeah trust me dude the Amos Yee rabbit hole goes DEEP. He made that video and they threw him in prison for "intent to incite religious conflict" or some bullshit cus he said one line insulting christians. He went to prison like 3 times or something, I can't actually remember. In prison they said that he had severe autism/aspergers syndrome or something and forced him to undergo psychiatric treatments.   When he got out after the third time, he booked a flight to the US and applied for political refugee status. He was granted refugee status but then the Federal court appealed that decision for some reason and he got detained in an ICE jail for like 6 months and was finally freed in September.   I originally followed him because he was a little dude that spoke out against an authoritarian government and stood against a massive online crowd of nationalists that told him to shut up and revere your elders. I unsubbed from him after he revealed himself to be a full enlightened atheist retard and made videos ripping up the Koran and generally just being a disrespectful little shit to everyone. He's a weird dude. He doesn't give a fuck about sides which is why he shat all over sargon and the other skeptics. He truly believes what he believes and faces the consequences for it.| 1| 2017-12-04 13:22:49
Destiny| Mysfwaccount93| I followed Amos Yee for years and I know that a LOT of Singaporeans hate him.

He was responsible for building Singapore from a little fishing town into a strong economic center in Southeast Asia. He was also known for suppressing free speech, free press, and other stuff that you would expect a dictator to do.

MGTOW| holocaust21| I hope you are right though paedohysteria is really entrenched. There's this one great guy, Amos Yee, who was first jailed in Singapore for offending Christianity/Islam but he then got political asylum in the United States. So what does he do? Well he then also says what you're not supposed to say there and he argues that paedophilia is OK. I really think the best way to defeat the system is to do what he does and say the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I just hope he can make a good example for us all and manage to avoid getting imprisoned for his views. He has received endless death threats for speaking truth to power.

Destiny| Gpzjrpm| I mean he is kind of right. The shit the alt-right argues for is easily just as bad if not worse. While obviously all sexual relationships between adult and child are rape and will probably have very bad long term consequences he says he doesn't advocate "stereotype" rape (violent rape). I'd wager that a fucked up adult through non-violent sexual abuse as a child is maybe still better off than a trans person in some fucking electric therapy or black people getting deported or any of the shit that the alt-right actually hopes for.  Again the shit he advocates is fucked up, but I don't really see a difference in shittines compared to the alt-right wich many people claimed "to die for to protect their free speech". Would they do it for Amos Yee too?  | 1| 2017-12-04 05:28:27
singapore| HarukiMurakarma| Amos Yee is a widely known figure in Singapore. A quick search of his name in this subreddit will reveal that news about him appears on this sub on a regularly basis. While some feel sympathy for him, for the most part Singaporeans have a negative opinion of Amos Yee, but often for different reasons. People here dislike him because (in chronological order):  1. He published a video insulting the founding Prime Minister of Singapore immediately after his death 2. He falsely accused his bailor of molesting him, then admitted that he did it to get media attention 3. He expressed extreme anti-islam and anti-christian opinions in a country with a very large muslim and christian population. 4. He is a vocal defender of paedophilia  As you can probably imagine, while some may not find the point no.1 very outrageous and may even approve of it, by the time people found out about the last point, public opinion in Singapore and on this subreddit has largely swung against Amos Yee. I hope this satisfies your curiosity. | 1| 2017-12-04 02:25:37

news| Blackpixels| Well, our whole city/country's an island 2/3 the size of New York **City**. We've got no natural resources like oil or what-have-you (heck, we had to import our water from Malaysia up North at the start), and when the British pulled out in the 60s we had barely any industry nor skilled workforce.  Some of our "founding fathers" had the vision to think far, and now, 5 decades later, we end up as the region's financial/maritime/educational/tech/air/medical travel hub. (And for that water issue? We pioneered technology that could [recycle sewage into drinking water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEWater).)  It's a very controlled economy and state, yeah. Some of us have gripes about the freedoms of speech(or lack thereof), dictatorial-style way th government runs the country, and other things. (Check out [Amos Yee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Yee).) But in the practical regards, we've done great and I have to say the government's been brutally efficient.| 1| 2017-12-03 00:29:02

Destiny| isycck| &gt; You defined it after the quote  I literally clarified it just so everyone knows what the word means.  &gt;Your edit, while not false, was designed to emphasize your own conclusion.  Not at all.You can read the quote without my addon,it will have the same meaning.  When you add word "hypothetical",quote doesn't appear to support your conclusion. I have no problem with you adding that word.  The word I added is irrelevant to this discussion.  Let me give you an example now,and I will replace the subject from pedophilia to racism.Destiny is trying to make a point that racism is bad,and Amos is in favor of it.  &gt;Amos Yee:"So basically you're absolutely fine with whites calling blacks a nigger?"  &gt;Destiny:"If we lived in an absolute utopian society where there was no stigma whatsoever on any type of racist activity then yeah you could make that argument"   Wouldn't you conclude out of this interraction that Destiny's argument is fucking pathetic,and not only that,it is in fact an admition that Amos's argument is superior? That would mean that he thinks if our today's society was improved to the point of perfection,in that perfect world racism would be fine.  There are two possiblities here for Destiny: 1)He does in fact agree that society would be better if we had no stigma around sex,which would result in pedophilia normalization 2)He was terrible at arguing against pedophilia and has lost the debate | 1| 2017-12-02 04:02:37

Destiny| mildly-moist| &gt;IMO, the real reason why pedophilia is wrong is because no observer could reasonably conclude that sex would not cause profound emotional and/or physical trauma to a child. There is a plethora of data and examples of the horrible effects of pedophilia, Amos Yee is either lying to Destiny or to himself.  This is completely untrue, though. the peer-reviewed non-clinical literature consistently shows the opposite of this.  The most comprehensive peer-reviewed meta-analyses on adult-child sexual relations ever conducted (Rind et Al [1997](https://sci-hub.bz/https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499709551891) and [1998](http://facstaff.bloomu.edu/jleitzel/classes/adolesnt/rind_et_al.pdf)), which combined data from all 66 of the non-clinical, non-legal studies on this topic, found that adult-child sexual contact caused no statistically significant long-term harm on average in samples that included a mix of consensual and non-consensual encounters. The samples that *only* included non-consensual encounters however did show evidence of long-term harm.  It stands to reason that if the harmful non-consensual encounters were removed from the mixed-consent samples, then the resulting consensual-only samples would actually show a net positive psychological effect on the children, which is precisely the point that Amos was trying to make throughout the debate.  Laypersons often like to cite clinical studies (studies that specifically focus on children that underwent psychological therapy for the trauma they endured due to sexual abuse) as evidence that adult-child sexual contact is inherently harmful, but these studies are completely invalid for evaluating the effects of consensual sex due to the sampling bias (Of course if you specifically go and choose the children that were traumatised by what happened, and ignore the children that didn't seek psychological help, then any study done on these children will come to the conclusion that adult-child sex is "harmful". The vast majority of these cases from this biased sample involve non-consensual sex.  Clinical studies also used to "prove" that masturbation was harmful due to these very same biases in the past, and anti-masturbation activists used to use these studies as the crux of their argument. Due to this, the idea that masturbation was harmful became so prevalent in the US that it became commonly known as "self-abuse" and non-religious circumcision of baby boys was implemented on a wide scale in an attempt to discourage them from "abusing" themselves when they grew up.  In other words, attempting to apply the results of clinical studies to the wider population is an absolutely horrible idea, but very few prominent people are actually willing to stand up and point out the misuse of these studies by laypersons on this topic, as they would immediately be called out as a "pedo-apologist" or something similar, potentially damaging their perceived credibility.| 1| 2017-12-02 02:10:29
Destiny| salsacaljente| destiny's argument was very good and subtle. my small gripe with destiny was that he should have made a detailed description of this "utopian" world to show how far gone this is. so that uninformed bystanders don't think that we are only 1-2 generations away from pedophile acceptance.   in amos yee world the lack of consent of a child is not a problem when the act itself is basically trivial. So in this "utopia" fiddling with a child is the equivalent of hugging a stranger. Destiny should have build up this utopian world with a bit more detail to demonstrate that its totally unthinkable. It's not that only nudity would be universally accepted you have to go so far as sexuality would be so trivial that people would grab each others genitals without consent and it won't be a big deal.| 1| 2017-12-02 01:40:50

singapore| topkek1993| &gt; And if I did do it, it **does not at all make sense** that legally, the 20-year-old that my 16-year-old self had sex with should go to prison for it  How does it not make sense? What is this "making sense" that Amos refers to, and with what evidence does he justify his stance?  &gt;if a person **below the age of 18** **perfectly consents** to having sex  How far below the age of 18? Is Amos referring to a 17 year old? A 16 year old? A 13 year old? A 9 year old? Or possibly, a 5 year old?   What does "perfectly consents" mean? Let us assume that there will be a 5 year old child, out of the many 5 year old children, that will agree to having sex, based on bribery and persuasion. Is that considered "perfect consent"*? This is the same old argument for a minimum age of consent: that a immature child's mind can be exploited and manipulated by a mature mind. And this argument should hopefully be justified by the same evidence or sound, logical theories that Amos Yee lacks in his speech about "making sense". Advice from psychologists, moral and ethics academia, neuroscientists and other involved professionals should be sought - and Amos Yee has not sought such advice, nor availed himself of any knowledge thereof.  Harvard may not have cancelled his speech because of censorship issues, but because Amos' words may have displayed a lack of education (logic, critical thinking tools) that lead them to doubt his abilities to speak well in front of a Harvard audience. In fact, going by his words in the article, I will nix the "maybe" - Amos definitely lacks logic and critical thinking tools.  &gt;And if I did do it, it does not at all make sense that legally, the 20-year-old that my 16-year-old self had sex with should go to prison for it?  Also, this sentence does not exhibit good grammar. At least not to me (caveat: I am not **good** at English).  All in all, Amos should lay off his Harvard speaking ambitions. | 1| 2017-11-28 01:58:13

So regarding 12 year olds what exactly is the "gravity" of it? You act like sex is bad. Sex is not bad. Sex is fun.

singapore| StealthEagle| &gt; Singaporean teenager Amos Yee is embroiled in yet another controversy after publicly voicing out support for pedophilia in his recent Youtube videos. &gt;  &gt; Yee has received harsh criticism and even death threats after posting three videos on the topic, on 15, 17 and 20 November, entitled *Why Pedophilia Is Alright*, *Don’t Discriminate Pedophiles*, and *Free Speech for the Pedophile* respectively. &gt;  &gt; The 18-year-old, who is presently in Chicago after having been granted asylum in the US, argued that pedophilia is acceptable in principle in his videos on the matter. &gt;  &gt; Yee has previously expressed controversial views on sexual age of consent laws, advocating that such laws should be eliminated: &gt;  &gt; &gt; “I feel that if a person below the age of 18 perfectly consents to having sex with an adult, he should be allowed to do it. And the adult who has sex with that person should not be sent to jail for it. &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; “I had thoughts that I wanted to have sex with 20-year-olds when I was 16. So why shouldn’t I be able to do it? And if I did do it, it does not at all make sense that legally, the 20-year-old that my 16-year-old self had sex with should go to prison for it?” &gt;  &gt; The teenager, who was set to give his first public talk at the prestigious Harvard University, alleged that the organisers of the talk had abruptly cancelled the event less than 24 hours before he was scheduled to speak because of these controversial views. &gt;  &gt; Yee alleged that this was the same reason why he was banned from the Mythopoeic Society Conference (MythCon) last month but stood by his views. He also vehemently denied claims that his views promote rape and child abuse – the teenager stated that he would “never promote violence to anyone.” &gt;  &gt; Asserting that he himself is not a pedophile in his most recent videos, Yee clarified that he is expressing his support for pedophilia based on principle. &gt;  &gt; Netizens have not taken kindly to the Singaporean and have characterised him as a pedophile or closet pedophile, a troll, an agitator, deluded, a threat to polite society, and an attention seeker: &gt;  &gt; http://media.theindependent.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/yeepedothreats1.jpg &gt;  &gt; Several YouTubers have also uploaded response videos pertaining to Yee’s recent videos and have excoriated his views online.| 1| 2017-11-25 13:54:58
news| Ron_Paul_2024| This is why Amos Yee wants to promote paedophilia, so that we would not have a problem with sexualising children.

Yes, Amos Yee is the Patron Saint of Paedophiles. | 1| 2017-11-25 09:09:05
drunkenpeasants| KingLudwigII| I don't think you understood my point then. I said *if* a five year old had somehow had a fully sexually devolved body.   Physical attraction is not a choice and its not something we can turn off or on at will. Like imagine there were some rare genetic abnormality that caused extremely fast sexual development so that a five year could end up with a fully sexually developed body. It absolutely would not be considered pedophillia to find her sexually attractive.   And I'm sorry, but the the allegations of me going into Amos Yee territory are complete horseshit. Amos Yee advocates for allowing adults to have sex with children. It is totally fallacious to assume that because I'm saying it's completely  normal to find someone attractive that therfore it's completely justified in having any kind of sexual contact with her. It would be completely normal for a heterosexual male to still find a woman who is blackout drunk sexually attractive. This doesn't mean that it's therefore ok to have sexual contact with her. | 1| 2017-11-25 08:25:20

Philippines| nagaabroadsila| &gt; I believe that there should be a freedom to offend someone which Singapore doesn't have and the Western countries have like the United States. Without freedom to offend, we cannot correct mistakes within ourselves.  Tsk tsk tsk. As I said earlier, these restrictions were made not because they feel like it but because of racial riots/tensions. Read up their history of it. Look at them now, way way ahead in racial harmony albeit not perfect, compared to the United States.   As for me, there should be a  proper place and time to dialogue on offensive issues like parliament and a "speaker's corner" which they have.   &gt; If you offend Lee Kuan Yew and the PAP, the government will bankrupt you especially politicians who want to oppose Lee family's dictatorship. Google Amos Yee. Again, if you can substantiate your allegations, show your evidence and hear it in court. I can't speak for the PAP but as for issues that "offended" LKY, I had examined it all and so far all paper trail seem to not favor plaintiffs.

He started off as some kid that people on the left and right hailed as a hero for daring to speak out against Singapore and long story short he had to seek asylum in America or he'd be killed. Then he received death-threats for speaking against Islam and then one day he made a video about why babies(yes I mean literal babies) can consent to sex and why child porn is a right and not a crime, necrophilia should be legalized and bestiality isn't a crime.

Here let me demonstrate. Fuck Lee Kuan Yew. You can check if I'm in jail in 6 months. 2. Roy Ngerng was sued by LHL himself for defamatory remarks about LHL. It's a civil suit; he paid damages to LHL and didn't go to jail. 3. LHY son got charged by AGC for contempt of court against the judiciary, not for anything he said against LHL personally. | 1| 2017-11-13 16:32:01
singapore| dravidan7| its all in the mindset. not like every singaporean goes around suing others for defamation. only certain men in white.   even if libel laws werent that over the top. still got many ways and means to control critics.  roy ngnerg also got fired from his hospital job in such a weird manner in that moh made a statement supporting hospital over his termination. his dad's hawker stall got apparent surprise visit from nea over cleanliness.   amos yee got charged with wounding with religious feelings. subjected to mental evaluations at imh for no obvious reasons. as the judge who granted him asylum noted. others have made racist statements and did not get charged. like the pro pap jason neo and calvin cheng.   same for jbj. got charged for no good reason. fought his case all the way to privy court in uk and was found innocent. didnt help much in the end. the pap just abolished the laws allowing one to appeal to privy court.   the problem with free speech in SG is that the public do not care.   see the case in usa, when disney tried to blacklist a newspaper over critical news. the others in media backed the newspaper and got the blacklist overturned.   we dont need usa level of free speech where hate is allowed to flourish.   but if people here think free speech and human rights are somehow alien or some western trap, they are not going to stand up for it. and thus let it be abused. we dont have to see the example of lhl siblings to know that just cause you didnt see any use for certain laws now doesnt mean it wont be usefull in the future. which is why people need to support things like free speech/press even if they dont see an immediate need or benefit. | 1| 2017-11-13 14:28:57

singapore| AmazingRW| First of all, there is the need to understand that expression freedom exists in various forms. The US version of it is not necessarily beneficial for other countries. With the differences in culture, global standing, and environment between Singapore and the US a reality, why should Singapore blindly imitate the constitution of another country?  I would caution you against being swept along by the wave of US values. They might not be the most best for us, and they do not have to be.  Secondly, perfect expression freedom does not exist in this world. All forms of free speech are regulated, and restricted in ways varying from one country to the next. Germany for example, outlaws the denial of the holocaust that could "result in public disturbance" (much like the religious and race protection laws here). Violators of the law could be fined or jailed up to 5 years.  Now, tell me, does Germany come to mind when people discuss about the lack of free speech? It doesn't, because there is a cognitive bias in the ways the West and the East are commonly viewed with regard to democracy and freedom. The West is usually assumed to be more successful.  The US too, has anti-hate speech laws. The reason we do not know about it is due to the culture and politics (these laws are rarely enforced). American politicians rarely sue for defamation damages, because it is simply not in the US' culture (the US also has a different interpretation of defamation).  I have to correct the examples you have brought up. Amos Yee has never been sued by anybody, and Roy Ngerng was sued by Lee Hsien Loong, not the government.  Lastly, it is crucial to understand that expression freedom and defamation laws are not mutually exclusive. Expression freedom, in the legal and constitutional sense, does not extend to people the rights to defame and hurt.| 1| 2017-11-13 12:50:21
singapore| luacs1998| &gt; What frustrates me the most about Amos Yee, and many other figures who are involved in this conversation, is that they all invoke free speech incorrectly.  I think a lot of us here do so, too. The old man was a great leader, but not exactly a good person (he believed in eugenics, for one). He knew the law, he was not afraid to use it. Hence why he sued so many people under his own name.  It's just that since we have been taught to correlate Old Man = Party = Country we have come to think that anything the old man (or LHL) does is on behalf of the state, and that it is a state action and not a private action taken by a private person.  The Constitution of Singapore can still provide guarantees of free speech, freedom of association, etc, but that loophole will always exist. Do you take away someone's constitutional rights just because they hold high office?| 1| 2017-11-13 07:10:40

singapore| bruindke| What frustrates me the most about Amos Yee, and many other figures who are involved in this conversation, is that they all invoke free speech incorrectly. Our First Amendment rights protects us *from the government*. We have the right to hold opinions and criticize government policies and officials, and as long as we are doing it peacefully, the United States government have very little legal recourse.  Private institutions (which Harvard is) and public opinion are a whole different matter. Neither the First Amendment, nor the American value of free speech, were meant to protect you from consequences stemming from those non-governmental sources. The United States *never* defined free speech in those terms.  In other words, Amos Yee can say all he wants that age of consent is horse shit or Muslims and Christians are dickeaters. The US government can't do anything about it and private institutions, organizations, and the public can respond in any way they see fit (again, assuming full legality of the responses). So NO, Amos Yee and alt-right and whoever else is making this horse shit argument: Harvard rescinding this invitation is *not* an attack on free speech.| 1| 2017-11-13 00:40:51
singapore| bookworm669| There's controversial opinions and then there's downright harmful and destructive beliefs.   Harvard probably wouldn't have invited a Westboro Baptist Church member who thinks gays should burn in hell, a radical Islam theologist who thinks women should be in subjugated positions in society. A dude who thinks you should be able to sleep with a 10 year old if you convince the 10 year old that they're really consenting after all is probably on par with those in terms of the destructiveness of said beliefs.   Amos Yee went full retard with the age of consent thing and did himself a great disservice by losing a lot of his credibility as a reasonable well-adjusted person when he came out with those views.| 1| 2017-11-12 19:31:19

singapore| Motherofcurry| Just to add - Ivies such as Harvard are highly committed to providing liberal education. They are well-known to have their students exposed to knowledge and affairs out of textbook curriculum (in other words, things that are "breakthrough" &amp; unconventional).   I suspect political scholars may be very interested in Amos' actions thus far and in his subsequent decisions. Keep in mind that Americans consider what Amos went through as suppression of freedom of speech by the government - and for someone who has went through jail and oppression for that, I won't be surprised if some liberal arts student came up with a thesis on this whole Amos Yee saga.  That said, I obviously still don't agree with what Amos did. Just said this in case anyone starts thinking "omg why Harvard making some weird singaporean exile into an academic celebrity". | 1| 2017-11-10 22:17:57

singapore| CharAznia| &gt; his problem isn’t some cooked up “fake news” founded in the grumblings of pro-opposition media. Our government is globally notorious for waging lawsuits on dissidents. Freedom of press is abysmal for a developed   U seem to be confusing a critique to baseless accusations. No one in the history of SG have ever gotten into trouble for the former. Just ask Catherine Lim. I love how the opposition supporters just love to spread their lies in the name of freedom of speech and cry censorship when they got caught out  So what if our media is directly owned by Temasek Holdings, haven't stopped them from criticizing the govt and occasionally promoting the opposition. Only those who have selective reading problems will claim those do not exist in our MSM. Furthermore  with the advent of the internet, there is nothing stopping other media from having different commentary. Case in point opposition propaganda website like TOC, TISG, etc. Ironically TOC and TISG mostly carry heavily censored version of the same articles U find in MSM yet those are the ones the pple claim are champions of free speech. The MSM do not practice political censorship they have a form of self censorship to ensure whatever they publish can be proven. Just because they are owned by TH have not stopped them from publishing pro-opposition/anti govt articles. You don't find too many of them simply because they do not publish things they cannot prove.   I standby my claim that there is no true political censorship in SG. U don't know what political censorship is until U'eve actually lived in an environment like China(I did). In SG when there is a clash or ideals, those ideals are debated upon in public, in print or in Parliament between our politicians and other stakeholders. In Countries with active political censorship, when there is a clash of ideas, U never knew there was one because they are never reported. Clearly it's not the case in SG. Maybe in the LKY era and early days of GCT era, but certainly not today  I do not deny that censorship of other topics can be politically motivated. One can debate if censoring certain content e.g. the Amos Yee anti-religious case is politically motivated(not sure how high U need to be to actually think the PAP head honchos was the one who wanted to bring down Amos). However I would like to point out that this kind of "censorship" happens all over the world including the US and EU. Why is it political censorship when it's done in SG but not when the US and EU does it.| 1| 2017-11-06 13:35:51

Due to this Yee has done very controversial videos, such as the one that landed him in jail. Where he compared the late prime minister to jesus and then proceed to rip into both of them.  While in the US this would of been seen as simply being going a bit to far and having people shun you, in Singapore it could land you in jail and for Yee it did.

singapore| Brainroots| The way we solve the Amos Yee issue is that we don't consider it an issue at all.  The kid would have never been on anyone's radar if it weren't for the government creating attention for him.  In the USA, he'll be lost in noise.  I don't anticipate his activism to accomplish much, if anything.  Most attention he'll get will come from Singapore, where he was made famous, not from the USA, where no one can find his country on a map.| 1| 2017-11-04 01:27:15

I don't know how to put this to you, but you really can't go round insulting real life people online crossing your fingers it doesn't come back to bite you in real life.  And he wasn't trolling. Because if he were trolling he would easily release a video saying 'ha ha guys its all a joke pls no jail' but nope he stuck to his guns and that's what landed him in jail. Singaporeans couldn't even be bothered too much over how his case was coming along. Like sure it got a 'haha Amos Yee is in Jail' and then like...I totally forgot he existed. Till this post I guess. Probably forget him after I'm done destroying you on this post.  Don't feel ashamed for your country. You're not worthy of representing the majority of our views. I betcha don't even agree with half of what he says. You just like being an edgy teen who likes supporting the 'oppressed'. Go back to playing computer games and studying. Stop picking up the shit we laid upon him like you actually change anything. Stop being the supporter that will never get as much back from him for how much you love him. Support Jake or Logan Paul. You've got a better chance at getting a geeky shoutout from them than in one of those serious, totally not joking videos of Yee's.  Singaporean's can handle criticism. We just can't tolerate rubbish. So can those comebacks of yours because in no situation can you ever disregard what you say online and not expect it to translate to real life repercussions.  Stop feeding yourself your own lies as well. You're not as a great a 'social justice' warrior by sticking up for him. Go fight the cause for the elderly, or the stigmatisation of the mentally ill (actually of which Amos Yee might fall under). You might have your voice heard better then.| 1| 2017-11-03 21:15:00
singapore| Makiwawa| I agree with you whole-heartedly. In fact, you your self should learn abit of it yourself, not taking offence at what others say about Amos Yee. It's like the pot calling the kettle black. Are you Amos Yee? No? Then it seems like you're getting angry/frustrated over something someone said about someone else.   You may want him to be Singaporean, and you may claim that he very well still is. To be fair though, I think Amos himself doesn't want to be part of us. So I would advise you to take up residence with him if you love him so much.  Lastly, go ahead and support his patreon! Support the man and his videos. Maybe one day he'll hurt enough feelings, including your own.  (I do hope you're kidding though, to get a reaction out of us. Props to you)| 1| 2017-11-03 20:06:52

singapore| cowbungaa| &gt; Our leaders (LHL, Tharman) are able to speak clearly without affecting a Western accent. I would consider that to be pretty neutral.  I would say those are examples of standard Singapore English spoken with good pronunciation. It sounds pretty neutral to me as well because it isn't distinctly American/British, but I'm not sure if an American/British would consider it to be neutral (hence my original comment that there isn't a truly neutral accent).  &gt; Specific accents signal prestige and class status. I think this is the real reason why some Singaporeans take to Western accents like a fish to water and turn it on when speaking to an angmoh.  You have a point, although I would argue that it's more a matter of proper English with good pronunciation rather than any specific accents. For example, I find Tharman's accent to be way classier than the highly exaggerated faux American accent used by Amos Yee.| 1| 2017-10-27 15:53:17

drunkenpeasants| Akibawashu| Amos Yee say wants child porn to be legalized, but it's a form of extreme free speech.  Now, mind you he doesn't want it to be legalized as it's possible he's trolling really hard, but more so to 'troll' an extremely unpopular idea for the idea of free speech and discussion for highly unpopular views. People saying he wants child porn to be legalized had already been baited by Amos Yee. He's quite cunning (though he's very self-centered so is TJ :P) in this tactic. Amos Yee doesn't really want child porn to be legalized but instead show the hypocrisy of those advocating free speech by attempting to demoralized, alienated, or censorship against a socially unpopular idea.  Amos Yee is pointing out a good question. "Should free speech applies even to those defending or encouraing acts that we as a society deemed extremely taboo such as Paedophilia?"  | 1| 2017-10-23 04:55:00

singapore| Laui_2000| True. Amos Yee is an outlier, even among foreign accented Singaporeans. I guess a more palatable example would be those social media "influencers" (or whatever they go by) who speak with American-esque accents.   And yes, I do admire the way that LHL and Tharman speak. Even the late LKY speaks very well. I like their neutral accent. Their accents sound fairly recognisably (to me at least) Singaporean, and at the same time they enunciate their words clearly. | 1| 2017-10-11 20:50:57
singapore| zzaaaa| Using Amos Yee as an example isn't fair though, he has the worst imitation of an American accent. It sounds like an extreme caricature of some sort of wild west movie character. And yes he does have quite a few screws loose.  I think the best examples of a Singaporean accent would be people like Lee Hsien Loong or Tharman, whom I try to learn from instead. The accent sounds local but still sounds pleasant, to my ears at least. | 1| 2017-10-11 19:49:52
singapore| Laui_2000| Funny, because many Singaporeans adopt foreign accents (whether intentionally or not, idk) and sound ridiculous to me but they don't realise this.  Something doesn't feel right when you see an Asian person who has never lived anywhere else other than here speak with an accent that sounds nothing like the local accent. Case in point is Amos Yee. And he turned out to be a nutjob. | 1| 2017-10-11 18:48:49
AskReddit| Afraidofdownvotes0| Can I just add some facts about Amos Yee? I don't want to let my opinion of him affect your judgment. Tell me what you think of him after these points.   &gt;Lee Kuan Yew (LKY) died in March 2015. Shortly after, Yee uploaded a video criticising LKY, comparing him unfavourably to Jesus Christ and implying Christians are “delusional and ignorant”, and uploaded to his blog an image of the late LKY and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher having anal sex.  &gt;Barely a day after he was convicted and released on bail, teenage blogger Amos Yee alleged that he had been molested by Mr Vincent Law, a family and youth counsellor who had stepped forward to bail him out.  Then a few hours later, after Mr Law told several media outlets that the allegation was "false", Yee posted again on Facebook to announce that it was all a lie.    &gt;Yee was sentenced on Sep. 2016 to jail and a fine, this time for dry-humping a Quran in a video and defying orders to assist with police investigations.   From a Facebook post on his page: &gt;Amos Yee’s planned list of illegal acts in Singapore:  2015 - Criticising the Government (Done) 2016 - Criticising religion (Done) 2017 - Skipping national service 2018 - Stepping on the national flag 2019 - Grafitti 2021 - Porn  2022 - Tax Evasion 2023 - Not Paying CPF 2024- Non-violent public protest 2026 - Taking marijuana 2030 - Hacking in and revealing private government files 2036 - trafficking marijuana/ attempting to sneak firearms into Singapore  What do you think of him now?| 1| 2017-10-11 17:06:45
AskReddit| lordsyphilitis| I know what the charges were. Bullshit charges as far as I can tell. I don't agree that he was inciting hatred for any religion (or race since you mentioned it though I don't have any idea where that came from).   I would rather have Amos Yee in this country than in Singapore. At least he's relatively safe here.| 1| 2017-10-11 12:47:45
changemyview| Murky_Red| Okay, have you considered watching the other side of YouTube, like Contrapoints, Shaun and Jen or Hbomberguy? Contrapoints has a nice video about pop feminism.   The thing about most feminist blogs is that they already assume a working knowledge of feminist epistemology in their readers, and it can be hard to understand for a newcomer. What they mean by words like intersectionality is very, very different from what Sargon means. Their generalizations seem extreme only because people like Sargon take it personally. When they say white people or black people, they mean generally, not every single white or black person. Sargon is an ideologue, who was willing to host a podcast with a child rape advocate like Amos Yee. I don't think he supports it himself, but this is the length he will go to in order to shit on his opponents.   It may be hard, but just lurk a site like Bitch Media for a while. Don't post at first just lurk for a bit. I am doing an M.A. in gender studies, and not once in class have they mentioned Anita Sarkeesian,  or any other pop feminist stuff. Find out what the feminist movement is like in your country. Maybe some of them have a blog.  I strongly suggest watching the above YouTubers, or getting your knowledge firsthand from reading. Feminism is for Everybody by bell hooks is a great starting point. Don't buy into the sjw myth, especially if you aren't from the USA. I actually heard people bringing them up in India, and it is simply not a thing here. Also, as an alternative to Gavin McInnes let me recommend r/menslib. Again, just lurk for a bit before posting.| 1| 2017-10-11 12:35:30
AskReddit| dasilvernoob| Sigh. He was not jailed for being critical. He was jailed for violating a section of the Penal Code which criminalizes the incitement of religious hate.  I know the majority of the audience here is located in USA and have a favourable impression of Amos Yee. If you actually lived in Singapore, like I have for my entire life, you'd realize that you don't want this guy in your country.   I agree our government can be too strict at times. But his case was such a clear cut one of inciting racial and religious hatred that he quite frankly deserved what he got. Just because he is outspoken does not automatically validate his claims.| 1| 2017-10-11 12:26:47

SargonofAkkad| Eheroduelist| &gt;Sargon is immensely dishonest and misleading.   Citation?  &gt;if you want to shrug off pedophilia as just "distasteful" then that's unsettling.  Sargon didn't endorse it though. He explicitly said, repeatedly, that he wants the age of consent to stay at 16.  I'm mixed on the resulting interview, but I'm intellectually honest enough to say that this isn't an indictment of Sargon, but instead of Amos Yee.  &gt;This shouldn't be a dealbreaker in itself if you're deep into the anti-SJW bubble, but might be a crack that helps you escape.  Only thing that makes me hate Social Justice more than any other political ideology is Social Justice. Even if I were to turn my nose up at Sargon because of this, I'd still hold the opinions I do now; unless you think there's legitimacy to the ideology buried somewhere beneath the mountains of evidence of racism, misandry, and cringey Feminism videos ?| 1| 2017-10-11 00:42:01

He doesn't answer.  He doesn't say anything until Sargon raises the age to teens, and then he agrees.  Amos Yee has on record thought that children could consent even if they were too young to know how to speak because there is body language.  You can have a conversation with someone like this. You can even have a conversation about this topic.  But there is a way to do it without completely failing.  Even without endorsing it, Sargon didn't challenge it.

singapore| EctoplasmDeposit| Hi Redditors, this is my first time on the sub, so please forgive this post if it contravenes (somewhat) certain submission guidelines as I'm not extensively versed in rediquette yet. With that little introductory tidbit out of the way, I'd like to maintain the provenance of this as a serious one, despite any chord it may strike wrongly with you guys. I'd like also, to open this comment up as a frank discussion of said affairs and contrarian notions in general.   On topic, I just had to get this out but it's come to my attention that the Singaporean government, along with branches like the Media Development Authority and affiliations, has been obstinately wilful in its collective attitude towards the extent of content regulation and enforcement. What do I mean by this? For starters, it's common knowledge here that freedom as a whole is rather anemic (our position in the World Press Freedom Index, for instance, stands at #151 currently, below both Ethiopia and Zimbawe, to further salt our gaping wound as a cornerstone of Asia---a metropolitan model for our neighboring countries to follow). To accentuate that, remember Roy Ngerng and Amos Yee? (and before anyone brings up Roy's unsolicited and I quote, "baseless allegations" regarding possible money laundering from involving PM Lee and the CPF, and Yee's incendiary remarks on religion and the late LKY----let us not forget how Roy was essentially bamboozled by the opposing stand into retracting his words, by way of a defamation suit, and in Yee's case, jail time for his viewpoints---made all the more egregious by the fact that he was barely 16 at the time of the video that elevated his stature from the local to international.) In understanding Roy's case, I'm fairly certain we can still agree that the suit may have been justified in some part, namely his lack of marshalling enough evidence to substantiate his findings, because let's face it, going up against the revered political party that's ruled over a country for 50 years is quite the David vs Goliath situation. However, Yee was simply an idealistic kid sharing a rather precocious worldview (and this writer is 15 at present, so I can relate immensely), and he had the conviction to champion insight/originality over ubiquity---in the audacity of his ideas, and their satirical, self-aware presentation. While he fell prey to overt narcissism or trite "shock-value" argumentation in his later videos, it's undeniable that had we allowed ample space for the development of his creative expression in an unrestricted school of thought free from the shackles of institutionalized conformism, draped in a surreptitious veil of seditious felony as rationale for incarceration, we would've gained exposure to differing yet no less essential views on national policies and political sensibility.   The purpose of this post, however, is far from being that of a rant piece for me to delve into a thesis on our seemingly flawed standards of freedom. Rather, I'd like to expand further upon the idea of censorship, more notably in the media. The aforementioned MDA imposes artistic legislature via its brand of movie ratings (for the uninitiated, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_censorship_in_Singapore, as a cursory read). This, of course begs the question of how we are exemplifying our status as a "nanny state" in the eyes of others. How effective or flexible can a "one-size-fits-all" approach to film classification be, as a means of preventing the influx of potentially harmful imagery/ethical values/warped teachings into the lives of all Singaporeans? (For the record, I'm simply using a microview of the arts industry here and focusing on movie ratings because I believe it's a large constituent of our lives here---and subsequently, the most approachable/relatable topic of contention.) Now, having the knowledge of these guidelines all screenings here have to abide by, how about comparing them to that of countries? Canada, the UK, or even America (of course, these tend to be Eurocentric in nature and perhaps functions as an apples-to-oranges comparison, except that we're trying to model our economic and business sectors after Western countries, and modernizing with them in an era of globalization and cultural permeation---so all things considered, it does seem less biased here---with the admission that it's still unfair to some perception.)  In Canada, motion picture ratings are administered across different provinces/territories, with the common ruling of mandatory parental guidance---the same for America, with its "R" rating passed by the MPAA---akin to most NC16/M18/R21 films here. In the UK, while they do have enforced ratings like us, that prevent underage patrons from entering age-restricted screenings, they're much more lenient with judging explicit impact/are more tolerant towards objectionable material like sexual content, violence or profanity, that the MDA/BFC's jurisdiction cuts down with a vengeance. Given our (strictly opinionated) draconian laws regarding homosexuality and gender identity, due in part to a more traditional societal zeitgeist affirmed by an Asian-centric society with East-oriented moral principles, our censorship system also minces scenes containing explicit depictions of same-sex intercourse, disregarding artistic integrity or any intent to convey unbridled passion/emotional reverie (case in point: more recently, The Handmaiden and Blue is the Warmest Color). While this piece doesn't carry the intent of plainly criticizing the government or nitpicking minute aspects of policymaking for the sake of inspiring divisiveness, I do wish that readers will consider this and reflect on Singapore's (perhaps overly) conservative approach towards the media, and how it's more a bane than a boon to us. Do we really feel that limiting the scope of narratives as depicted on film in order to appease certain groups will aid us in addressing our more innate vulnerabilities as a society, and strengthen our cause for contemplation on topics of gray areas, that we would never've pondered on otherwise? And most of all, should the government pander to its more prudent roots and exercise orthodoxy in its self-appointed role of micromanaging internal issues, doing the job of parents by regulating their children's media consumption? (also on the subject: Porn is actually banned in Singapore---i'm not trying to invoke comic relief into a serious matter---but it's something I've always found honestly ridiculous and illogical--but more on that in the comments)   To sum this all up, these simply represent the stream of consciousness of a slightly world-weary teen caught in an inexplicable existential crisis here that's best reserved for another post. While I hate to bring in my age into such topics because I feel more often that not, it tends to affect or redirect discussion in a disingenuous manner, I feel it'd be an integral talking point here considering how it may invalidate my views to a degree given a lack of true depth of world experience, or a narrowed social ecosystem. Also, giving more context into my more outspoken views, I've always been an ardent advocate of free speech and artistic manifestation, along with harbouring a passion for film criticism/appreciation, so it's something that's deeply personal to me as well---the catalysis for this midnight dissertation being the upcoming release of Blade Runner 2049 (a film I've been hyped for since genesis, given my fascination with the original as one of the most innovative/evocative seminal sci-fi works I've had the pleasure to experience, coupled with Denis Villeneuve helming it, then again this isn't r/movies so I digress.) and its condemnation with the slap of an NC-16 rating (which is an insane bummer, because I'll only turn 16 in 2 1/2months---and... you get the idea.) Well, that and the compelling force that drove me being my unconventional outlook for a teenager, I just felt that I had to do this if no one my age would, if only to spark questioning and heated debate---constructively, of course. All responses are welcome given the polarizing nature of this topic, and I'll be sure to fill in any blanks in my writing (it's archaic I know, but for better or worse, a natural integration into my normal vernacular).| -21| 2017-10-05 23:25:51

For their side swipe technique, I will respond with sedia command, rooting myself to the ground as they fail to move my body. Horse stance has been around for thousands of years, adapted to handle nature's biggest threats.   The "play phone on loudspeaker" mode? Simple. Quickly fake a phone call, loudly stating that your relative just died and that the car numbers are "XXXX???"    Watch them immediately change from candy crush to write down the numbers you spout out. Delay the numbers as slowly as possible, pretending to get them wrong as long as you need them to be distracted.    "Tsk tsk TSKKKKKKK"? That is nearly undefeatable. When they start their tsk sequence, you must counterstrike immediately like Mayweather and his wife. How? Simply exclaim "AIYO HOW CAN LIDDAT?" while looking at a different direction to break their tsk combo... create a quick diversion and leave before they lock onto you like PM Lee onto Amos Yee.   ....Once it hits 3 times combo you will kena the tskdouken that will leave you covered in last week's cai png/bee hoon fragments + if unlucky it will critical hit into a stomp post combo.

When I dig for news to do my work, I like the local msm (I know the news quite one sided la, but at least most people have brains and the means to deduce and investigate further)  Anyway, my opinion, media freedom is just an excuse for the media companies to look legit enough so they have the authority to create whatever content they like, without restrictions.   The same restrictions do not cost mortals like us a lot of money (unless we do one roy or Amos yee), but they cost these media companies many zeroes just to build the correct content. | 2| 2017-10-01 10:50:48

singapore| mee_sua| &gt; the oppies are also at fault when they scream down the house over this and that and basically hand over all their trump cards. This is why PAP did so well at demonizing CSJ, and how they've (somewhat) succeeded with Amos Yee as well.  In the 90's, Chee knew he could not attack the PAP based on their competence and economic record, so he resorted to provoking PAP into draconian measures that would highlight their authoritarian nature, and paint him as a victim of oppression. The entire point of his provocative demonstrations and hunger strike antics was to garner sympathy from Singaporeans, which backfired dramatically. What little political mileage he gained was from liberal overseas sympathisers, which only gave PAP more ammunition to portray him as a foreign collaborator. Nowadays he has changed his tack but it's a very steep climb for him.| 4| 2017-09-29 16:08:56
singapore| mee_sua| &gt; To say that Amos Yee's treatment was disproportionate is to imply that his treatment was more severe than other people charged under the Sedition Act.   You're approaching the topic of his treatment arguing for the fairness of the judge's ruling based on legal precedence and the presumption that the Sedition Act (itself a very broadly worded law), was applied with adequate justification by the prosecution. I don't know enough about the law to agree/disagree with that, but I do not dispute whether the judge's decision is commensurate with the charges made towards Amos Yee.    The question of the treatment of Amos Yee does not end with the legal ruling in the courts. His status as a public enemy was further amplified by the media, and the various police reports and social media schadenfreude revealed the vindictiveness of a society that could not tolerate a churlish video they could choose not to watch, to the point where a random guy felt brave enough to attack him in public.   Amos Yee's case also had a widely perceived political tangent to it - he was originally charged with insulting LKY under Protection from Harassment Act (later dropped). I'm sure you've seen comments on Facebook that inflict far more grievous wounds on religious harmony, but Amos Yee was singled out by the authorities, for whatever reasons there may be. We should not forget that he was a teenager even though the authorities insisted on trying him as an adult.   This is a quote from his lawyers about his ordeal  &gt; “There was little doubt that Amos was suffering at Changi Prison as he started having suicidal thoughts and also suffered from loss of appetite. He was concerned about the prospect of RTC as this was not envisaged earlier and he felt it was wholly unjust and disproportionate to the offences for which he was convicted. This was compounded by Amos being sent to IMH for a further 2 weeks, making it a total of 5 weeks since 2nd June 2015 of being in some form of remand. As Amos’s lawyers, we were deeply concerned of the strain on his mental state and his physical state in the long period of remand.   We may have our own special laws and extraordinarily fragile societal fabric, but I'm not sure if a rebellious teenager who made a stupid video needed to go through all that in the first place because he was "asking for it". Amos Yee may have wanted escalation, but the authorities gladly played chicken with him at each turn because they thought he would eventually be sobered by the trials and detention. Unfortunately, they underestimated his shamelessness which made both sides look petty as neither the state nor Amos Yee were willing to live and let live. | 3| 2017-09-29 15:55:03
singapore| starrRiver| He could have avoided remand entirely if he didn't falsely accuse his bailor of molestation. Why do people always forget that he was granted bail? Him being in remand was 100% of his own doing. He would have avoided a custodial sentence completely by accepting the probation that he was offered but rejected. That would have been all; he wouldn't have had to spend a single day in prison for the LKY video he posted.  Or he might even have avoided being charged altogether if he had just accepted a police warning and issued an apology like what most people do when they get a warning from the police. But no. Amos Yee wanted escalation;he wanted to do "a little dance" with the government.  To say that Amos Yee's treatment was disproportionate is to imply that his treatment was more severe than other people charged under the Sedition Act. But Amos Yee was given discretionary benefits that the prosecution and the court were not obliged to grant here. He got bail. He got probation.   There are people who have been given custodial sentences without probation before when charged under the Sedition Act. Dorothy Leng and Ong Chong were given 8 week custodial sentences for distributing chick tracts here. Amos Yee objectively got way better treatment than these people, but somehow his treatment was still "disproportionate". Are people saying that Amos Yee should get BETTER treatment than other people who broke the same law? Does the rule of law and equality before the law suddenly cease to matter when the law is applied against someone who criticized the government?   Try putting yourself in the judge's shoes. Can you think of a lighter possible sentence in that situation than what was given? His sentence was set off against the period in remand, literally the best possible outcome in that situation that led to his immediate release.   Or put yourself in the position of the prosecution. A bunch of people reported this guy to the police. He was given warning, but was rejected. You tried to give him probation, but it was rejected. Perhaps reformative training? Also rejected. Is the prosecution supposed to just ignore a clear breach of law that multiple people reported without even an official warning? Is that the only way for his treatment to be not disproportionate? How is that fair to Dorothy Leng and Ong Cheong? And how would that square with their duty to enforce the law? | 12| 2017-09-29 14:16:19
singapore| luacs1998| &gt; heavy handedness and disproportionate nature of the government's treatment of Amos Yee - the manner of his arrest, his detention and remand at IMH, the entire media circus over his trial  I don't disagree that it's not something a 17-year-old should be put through, but didn't Amos go on the record himself saying that he was deliberately escalating the situation in search of martyrdom?  The government does have a habit of killing ants with hammers, but the oppies are also at fault when they scream down the house over this and that and basically hand over all their trump cards. This is why PAP did so well at demonizing CSJ, and how they've (somewhat) succeeded with Amos Yee as well.| 2| 2017-09-29 14:15:37
singapore| mee_sua|  There are actually several factors that demonstrate the heavy handedness and disproportionate nature of the government's treatment of Amos Yee - the manner of his arrest, his detention and remand at IMH, the entire media circus over his trial. These have all been ignored thanks to his foolish antics which greatly diminished any sympathy he could have attracted. All that is left of his "legacy" is an awful test case for those who decry freedom of speech as more bane than boon.| 5| 2017-09-29 12:58:18
singapore| nextlevelunlocked| &gt; Not every offence is prosecuted in court. If it were mandatory to prosecute every time an offence is committed, the courts would be jam-packed with jaywalkers and litterbugs. This is where prosecutorial discretion comes in. The public prosecutor can decide whether or not to prosecute. The question is, on what grounds?  &gt; It is obviously not possible for the Attorney-General to look at every individual file to decide whether to prosecute.  talking about certain asylum seeker?  meaning amos yee file came to ag desk while the other 2 pro govt guys didnt?  ag also didnt give any convincing reason for not charging the other 2.   especially considering amos yees initial video that started it all had less religiously offensive stuff than what jason neo and calvin cheng said. | -11| 2017-09-29 11:28:28

What you're doing is basically the same as what the others did to Amos Yee, which is really hypocritical of you. And if I were wrong in any way whatsoever, anyone can feel free to jump in on me.

atheism| AmazingRW| Judging by your comments, OP, I am not so sure if you are fully aware of the sequence of events which led to Amos Yee's jailing. Allow me to explain.  In Singapore, racial and religious insensitivity is taken very seriously due to its stance on maintaining a multi-cultural society and its past history with racial and religious riots.  Prior to Singapore's independence, it went through an ideological conflict with Malaysia (which it was part of), and it escalated into racial politics. Malaysia is run on a communal system that favours people of a particular race. Malaysian politicians then incited the Malays in Singapore to turn against the Chinese, claiming that they were a threat that oppressed the Malays (the natives).  This led to a lot of bloodshed in the form of race riots, where people hacked one another to death openly on the streets. For Singapore, the topic of race and religion has since been treated extremely carefully, much like how the Germans deal with their Nazi history. Every country has something that it places an excessive priority on. For America, it is freedom and the history of slavery.  Now that we are done with the societal context, let us go back to the original topic on Amos Yee. Amos Yee was charged for hurting religious feelings, yes, that is correct. However, he was not supposed to be jailed. What does this mean?  During the trial, Amos Yee was held in the police's custody (jailed). Under normal circumstances, people who are charged would post bail, and would not be jailed. In this case however, Amos Yee repeatedly defied court orders and broke bail conditions. Not once, but multiple times.  As a result, his father was enraged and refused to bail Amos Yee out. A Christian man then posted bail for Amos Yee, citing his desire to demonstrate the Christians' generosity and to show that the Christians were not hurt by Amos's offending content. After being bailed out, Amos Yee turned around and accused the man of molestation (which was later proven to be baseless). His explanation? It was merely a prank. Amos then went on to break bail conditions again.  Thus, Amos Yee remained under police custody (jail) during the trial period. In spite of his uncooperative attitude and the lack of remorse, the courts sentenced him to probation only.  Following this, Amos Yee intentionally failed to show up for probation sessions, and refused to get in touch with the probation officer. He voluntarily asked for a jail sentence from the courts, and the courts obliged.  Hold up, you mean to say that someone chose jail over probation? It feels made up! The kid must have been forced into this!  Sorry, that is incorrect. Amos Yee chose a jail sentence because he wanted to have it backdated. Remember when he was held in police custody because his father refused to bail him out? Yes, that period of custody can be used to backdate whatever jail term he would face. Amos Yee likely did some calculations and figured out that he could walk away without probation by requesting for a jail term, then have it backdated.  All in all, Amos Yee could have gotten away with just a fine. His self-aggravating actions got him a jail term.| 3| 2017-09-27 10:22:42
singapore| CharAznia| Obviously a case of no research done  Those 2 were never charged not because they were not anti-PAP, its because they took the message down and apologized  There are many incident from the opposition activist who made contempt of court statements and were given only warning messages  Amos Yee on the other hand was given the same treatment, he was told to take it down and apologize. He refused and repeatedly re-offended during the investigations into his case.   Those who thinks this is anything to do with him being anti PAP is probably another one of those clueless PAP haters who doesn't know wtf is going on| 19| 2017-09-27 10:17:59
singapore| AmazingRW| To put it simply,  1. Amos Yee was jailed during police custody. Why? Because he intentionally broke bail conditions imposed by the courts. Not once, but multiple times. Remember the Christian man who bailed him out? He did so because Amos's father had given up on him and refused to post bail. (Little did the man know that Amos would go on to accuse him of molestation) 2. Since he was jailed during the trial, he decided that a formal jail sentence could be backdated. Hence, he intentionally chose a jail term.  It is right to say that the courts did not want to sentence him to jail.| 22| 2017-09-27 09:39:44

It could just be that no one reported it to the police, or they just got a warning from the police and accepted the warning.  In contrast for Amos Yee if I recall correctly riled up a lot of people to report him to the police and he refused to accept a warning? Could be why things kept escalating from there on.

singapore| luacs1998| If we don't expect them to ever succeed, how do you think they can?   I think to truly threaten the PAP, we must make the PAP feel that they are disposable and can be replaced anytime. And that requires having a strong opposition, one that thinks they're ready to govern at any time.  If we don't have the mindset in the first place, how can the opposition grow? If the opposition is made up of people like CSJ and Amos Yee, the PAP can just demonize them as a bunch of nutjobs that one would be insane to leave the country to. But the day the opposition runs on a platform that's not "we're not the PAP, fuck them, right?" is the day we will have a real opposition in Parliament.| 4| 2017-09-21 11:29:55

Listen to [this guy](https://youtu.be/I_s6QqmJd7k?t=166) for tonal pronunciation, he's not using big words like Amos does, but he gets his points across and definitely knows the shit he's talking about and accurately presents the wrong version vs the right version.

singapore| starrRiver| Actually Buzzfeed News (as opposed to Buzzfeed itself) did initially harbour ambitions to be a serious news organisation, notwithstanding its parent website's association with click bait listicles. [In 2012 they hired two big name editors from Politico and Rolling Stone.](https://gigaom.com/2012/10/10/kings-of-long-form-new-yorker-the-atlantic-and-buzzfeed/) Their[ longform section](https://www.buzzfeed.com/alysonmartin/smoking-pot-can-get-you-kicked-off-transplant-lists-even-in?utm_term=.kl0a7zOkQq#.dmZeN6oqXJ), while sometimes hit and miss, covers serious social and political issues in the US at length.   While I can't speak for the accuracy of content, the tone and effort of research in these articles puts them at least in the same editorial space as online liberal news organisations like Slate and Salon, and like what the ST writer wrote, these left wing online news sites marketed themselves as being a better alternative to traditional news media. If you remember, Buzzfeed news was the organisation that first released the infamous Trump dossier. So while the article on Singapore and Amos Yee is really terrible, the way Buzzfeed News is being summarily dismissed in this thread is really more indicative of their poor branding strategy than anything else. | 16| 2017-09-03 17:02:30

As committed as actually driving to meet Amos Yee is, I do get the sense that these writers don't really care much for how our culture works. Haw Par Villa's treated as a pillar of some strange communitarian, conformist norm rather than the weird attraction it is.  Even if one doesn't believe the crux of the case is regarding what he says about religion, the very nuances of the case are painted over in broad strokes to make some big point about universalized free speech: what's a 'legitimate Singaporean law' anyway?

EDIT: Possibly this is the most downvoted comment I've ever made. Considering it *truly* provides nothing to the current conversation, it's a fair cop.  (I commented anyway because I was, and am, frustrated. I acknowledge in hindsight that this thread is not the right one to have made my point in.)| -41| 2017-08-30 18:16:14
pics| mentalgamez| Well to those saying we should censor Nazis, my country (Singapore) already enforces [censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Singapore). Here's a recent [example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Yee) of how that turned out.   I personally don't agree with Amos Yee, but I doubt anyone in the United States want to be thrown in jail for insulting Trump, or for speaking against religion.   If you want to enforce freedom of speech, then everyone gets to freely and openly say what they want without fear of censure, even if they happen to be spreading Nazi propaganda. It's good to censor the Nazis, not so good anymore when the same laws are applied back on you. | 8| 2017-08-29 11:31:10
atheism| hyakumatsuri| Yes what you said is true, especially since our country is very religiously diverse with large Christian and Muslim populations. Amos Yee is a total jackass especially when he falsely accused his Christian bailer of molesting him after being jailed for "offending the religious beliefs of Christians". He should have been prosecuted based on that libel.   The US takes a different approach however, because of almost absolute freedom of speech, despite large swaths of the country believing in Christian fundamentalism, shows such as South Park and Family Guy can mock religion all day (although not always in good taste). Christians are certainly able to respond (within their free speech rights) to boycott, petition and write letters. However nobody is going to make  police reports just because their religious feelings get hurt like in Singapore. | 1| 2017-08-25 00:28:06
atheism| TheDestructiveDonut| Personally I believe that criticism of religion has to be very careful as criticism can easily lead to social tension (consider the Amos Yee case). Needless to say the feeligns of religious people are usually "fragile" so it's never a good idea to mention religion in public. | 2| 2017-08-24 20:46:04
singapore| beepboopww| I agree; it sounds like it was written by an edgy secondary school kid who frequents r/Iamverysmart. Or Amos Yee.| 18| 2017-08-23 23:25:49
KotakuInAction| MagosBiologis| No, I don't think it's morally equivalent. I think one has less personal freedom in America than Singapore, especially if you're a foreigner.  If wanting to put someone under probation for insulting Christians after a proper trial is bad, then putting someone in solitary confinement for insulting Muslims with no charge or trial is worse, and jailing someone for 8 months with no charge/trial/habeas corpus is even worse.  You need some serious mental gymnastics to believe that a system capable of holding people accused of no crime indefinitely without trial, is more free than a system capable of holding people indefinitely without trial if there is evidence that they are going to commit a crime.  And SG state media doesn't even want to report on Amos Yee any more. I got my information from his FB page, run by activists sympathetic to him.  https://www.facebook.com/amosyeebanana/posts/1349987581714509  https://www.facebook.com/amosyeebanana/posts/1414239205289346  https://www.facebook.com/amosyeebanana/posts/1550042798375652| 4| 2017-08-23 21:00:12
KotakuInAction| md1957| It's one thing to feel incensed by the slander coming from a Western media that simultaneously abhors and longs for the authoritarianism seen in Singapore.   It's another for force moral equivalency or buy all the anti-American spiels from the media and Regressive Left at face value. Not to mention pissing over Amos Yee, whatever his politics may be, and buying into Singapore's media narratives...which aren't really much better than their Western counterparts.| 7| 2017-08-23 20:50:17
KotakuInAction| MagosBiologis| &gt;  "jail for chewing gum" isn't entirely hyperbole  Again, Western hyperbolic slander. You can't get jailed for chewing gum. You can't get jailed for bringing in small amounts of chewing gum. You can be fined for importing chewing gum, or fined for spitting it on the streets. You can import, chew and properly dispose of medicinal gum (e.g. nicotine gum) legally.  &gt; YouTube Amos Lee who have been jailed for criticizing Lee Kwan Yew, however much it's downplayed with whatever legalese or technicality.  Western slander again. This is on  the level of "Zoe Quinn was chased out of her home by misogynists after her jilted ex raised a mob of goobergaters on her".   He was charged with "deliberate intention of wounding the religious or racial feelings", after insulting Christianity. Note that you can get charged for insulting any religion, or even atheism (e.g. Chick Tracts). The court wanted to give him with counselling and probation, but *Amos Yee requested for a jail sentence*, probably to attract Western sympathy, so he got it. He ended up spending a total of 21 days in jail.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Yee  FYI, he is currently in **an American jail right now**. He's been detained there after requesting asylum. His request was initially accepted, but the US has appealed it. While in jail he managed to go around insulting Muslims, and **got put in solitary confinement by the US government for insulting Muslims**.  http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/amos-yee-detained-in-the-us-seeking-political-asylum-his-mother--7655292  http://www.theindependent.sg/amos-yee-allegedly-in-solitary-confinement-in-the-usa-for-insulting-muslims-in-jail/  So, he's been jailed in Singapore for 21 days, after requesting to be jailed instead of being put under probation. He's been jailed in America *since December 2016 to August 2017 now (8 months and counting), with no crime, no charge, no trial, no right to habeas corpus, and no release in sight* (am I seeing a pattern here?) after seeking asylum.  Western media refuses to report on this. Of course they won't. It doesn't fit their narrative that America is the land of the free and Singapore is an oppressive authoritarian unfree hellhole.  Lastly, you guys can keep Amos Yee, as he "spreads his political message of anarchist communism and ending private property and wage labor". We don't want him back.  http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-singapore-blogger-idUSKBN14J1ZC| 5| 2017-08-23 20:36:17
singapore| Cryxtalix| Modern acceptance doesn't mean accepting everything LGBT groups push for. People like me and OP are only accepting to anything that we know is properly factually supported. We still have lingering doubts and concerns. Doesn't mean everyone with a "modern mindset" must immediately support repealing 377A. In fact, the modern mindset seems to be about blindly siding what everyone thinks is right, while deliberately ignoring any concerns.  And in trying to be all accepting, you are willing to exclude those that you believe are not as broadly accepting you. It is also due to people like you that totally favours the arrest of people like Amos Yee because he's not as accepting as you want him to be.   Yes, Introducing more regulation doesn't help anyone. Removing all semblance of regulation doesn't help anyone either.  You trying to shut down discussion of LGBT issues to try to "help" the LGBT community? Like I mentioned, many still have doubts and concerns, that end up being bottled up because discussion is always overwhelmingly one sided.

singapore| WikiTextBot| **Amos Yee**  Amos Pang Sang Yee (Chinese: 余澎杉; pinyin: Yú Péngshān; Wade–Giles: Yü2 P'eng2 Shan1; Jyutping: jyu4 paang1 saam1, born 31 October 1998) is a Singaporean YouTube personality, blogger, activist, and former child actor.  In late March 2015, shortly after the death of the first Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, Yee uploaded a video on YouTube criticising Lee. In the video Yee compared Lee to Jesus, and cast both in an unfavorable light. Yee also uploaded to his blog an image depicting Lee and Margaret Thatcher engaged in anal sex.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/singapore/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24| 3| 2017-08-11 16:26:02
singapore| cowbungaa| &gt; Oh yah and he would have completely breezed through NS with his commanders knowing who he is? Please.  The vast majority of Singaporean males do not breeze through NS. In particular, if you insist on acting like an asshole in NS, you will get tekan regardless of whether your name is Amos Yee or Adam Lee. Amos Yee isn't a special snowflake; he doesn't deserve special protection or release from his NS obligations just because he likes to act like an asshole.  &gt; We could have gotten a 16-year old boy help and counseled him instead of prosecuting him.  I suggest that you actually read up on the details of Amos' case before jumping to the conclusion that we didn't try to help or counsel him. His [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Yee) is a good start. Some choice excerpts:  * During the court hearing, Yee, who faced a fine and up to three years jail, had requested to be jailed instead of going for probation after being sentenced guilty by Kaur. The prosecution requested that Yee be given counseling and probation.  * On 27 May 2015, Yee was called back to court for an urgent hearing as he refused to meet with his assigned probation officer. The prosecution called for a report to assess Yee's suitability for reformative training, arguing that a jail term or a fine would have no rehabilitative effect.  * Yee rejected the option of probation and instead pleaded for a jail term.  Oh, and guess what happened to the kind stranger who went out of his way to help Amos and bail him out with $20k?  * On 13 May 2015, a day after being released, Yee took to Facebook alleging that he had been molested by his ex-bailor Law.  * He then proceeded to call Law a "molester", a "mentally unsound person" and a "hypocrite".  I believe any reasonable person who sees the above information will come to the inevitable conclusion that Amos only has himself to blame for the stuff he went through.| 10| 2017-08-11 16:25:57
madlads| Jagd_Zelpajid2| Amos Yee was charged but there wasn't any lawsuit. In Singapore the official definition of an adult is someone above 16 so it is probably lower than most western standards.| 2| 2017-08-10 23:58:19
madlads| CD-ROM| Okay. Let's use a [neutral news source](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-singapore-blogger-idUSKBN16W00I).  Amos Yee was granted asylum in the US (although the court decision is under appeal from the US Government now.  He is detained due to the appeal not because of whatever you say which doesn't even appear in any reputable news source).  The judge specifically mentioned that what he faced in Singapore "constitute(s) persecution on account of Yee's political opinions".   I admit that a 17/18 y.o. "anarchical communist"'s case might not be the best example in the world to use to illustrate a point, but it would be silly to say what he experienced in Singapore didn't at least hint towards excessive limitation on freedom of expression by the authorities.  It should be worth noting that other countries being "worse" than or being "equally as bad" as a particular country doesn't say much. Who doesn't know Malaysia/the US is not a paradise? If you are going to show worse examples, why not drag even more countries e.g. China into discussion? | -2| 2017-08-10 16:56:11

vainglorygame| Giveme2018please| Try having a government that bans all forms of fun, while making the locals a second class citizen to foreign expatriates, while also enforcing an iron rice bowl of rule where you can't say anything opposing if not you'll be sued by them and possibly jailed.  For example, go google the case of Amos Yee.  There's also hard facts about this country like a birth control policy in the 80s, active discrimination against lower class people (there was a policy to pay them to get ligations/vasectomies), and also, not to forget, an enforced 2 year military service for all 18 year old males that disrupts their education, which also actively discriminates against the indigenous Malay communities by putting them solely into the civil defence force instead of the military, all while subjecting them to much more often drug tests to throw them into military prison.  And also the government systematically removed the languages of the different Chinese groups here, cutting off our heritage and ability to communicate with our grandparents. My grandmother can only speak my dialect and mandarin. I only know two words of my dialect, and my mandarin is subpar beyond belief.     But yes, the country is safe and the food is good.   And I even have slight paranoia writing this that the government will come after me for writing such a statement. You wouldn't have that in the US, I could trash trump for days but I'd never find the police at my door for calling him an idiot. Unlike here.    However if I am in Singapore when worlds happen, I definitely will extend out a free invite for any world team that wants a tour of the city for them though. Would personally love to bring VONC to Chinatown and see how he reacts, or meet excoundrel in person and thank him for his awesome guides, and possibly force him to try some durian.

singapore| starrRiver| &gt; there is a very strong public perception that it is corrupted and compliant to the singapore government.  This is a gross simplification of a complicated issue. There have definitely been accusations that Singapore's defamation laws have helped to restrain political speech, but Singapore is also ranked [9th in the world in the rule of law index.] (http://sbr.com.sg/economy/news/singapore-ranked-ninth-globally-in-rule-law-index) Internationally, Singapore is also one of the [most popularly chosen spots for international arbitration.](https://www.whitecase.com/sites/whitecase/files/files/download/publications/qmul-international-arbitration-survey-2015.pdf) Singapore is also ranked one of lowest in the world in [perception of corruption. ](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-climbs-to-7th-on-global-least-corrupt-index) If the judiciary is so obviously corrupt and dysfunctional, then why are these foreign experts and businessmen still so stupid and choosing again and again to place faith in our judicial system? Because outside of defamation cases, there is no evidence to suggest that the judiciary regularly rules in favour of the government on other issues involving the government as one of the parties, like contracts involving government or government related entities.      You also mentioned that the judiciary having to somehow "prove" its impartiality. The suggestion here seems to be that this can only be done if the judiciary can play the role of opposition and rule against the PAP in some public way and defeat its agenda. But how exactly can it do that when the PAP has 2/3 majority in parliament? Statute trumps common law, and even the constitution can be amended by the PAP. By the way, the court has ruled against the government's agenda in Chng Suan Sze case before. Guess what happened after? The government simply amended the Constitution to get the result it wanted. The court also ruled against the government in a recent case involving a match fixer. The police simply released and re-arrested him on other grounds, because the way our laws are written simply gives the executive a lot of power. There's really not much the courts can do.  Back to this particular case, should it convict or not convict the nephew of the sitting Prime Minister? Which outcome better "proves" its impartiality? And should it simply ignore the new Administration of Justice (Protection) Act, enacted by a democratically elected parliament, just to "prove" its impartiality and punch the PAP in the face? The judiciary didn't charge him, the AGC did, and now the court has to respond by applying the law as it is written, not the law as you and I want it to be.   Another example: you were a judge trained in the law, would you have let Amos Yee off the hook for violating the law that parliament enacted lawfully because of your personal opinions in the matter? Is it the judiciary's fault that the wording of the Sedition Act is worded so broadly, or is it the fault of our parliament and the electorate's apathy towards basic human rights? To me, the answer to these questions is not to berate our judiciary for doing their jobs under a difficult environment, it's to lobby your politicians and exercise your rights during elections at the ballot box. I will admit, I would also like to see an activist bench take on the PAP's authoritarian tendencies head on, like the Warren court in the US during the civil rights era, but I don't think it's realistic to ask our courts to do that given the political and legal structure that we have right now. | 8| 2017-08-05 20:50:01

Example here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedition_Act_(Singapore) and perhaps if you're American you may know the infamous Amos Yee case where he sought refuge for his hate speech in the USA.   I think you could see how it could be referenced to your final point, and ultimately we don't have the jury system.

singapore| MrFoxxie| First amos yee point: he was offered probation after multiple fines for flamebaiting, he only went to jail after refusing every other form of punishment. We didn't intentionally jail him for fun.  For the other creative vs rigid points, it's not specifically a Singapore-only phenominon.  It's an Asian problem. People in Japan are also taught and brought up from a young age to be as undisruptive as possible and keep the status quo. If anything, Singapore is slowly breaking out of that problem with every new and younger generation.  With regards to our creative side, not everyone can be creative. And when your 'talent pool' is much smaller than other countries', it becomes easy to fault a country that has no significant representation as having no representation.  Art isn't something that everyone can do, even with loads of effort. Same with other creative directions. With a large population, there's a larger chance to get those artistically inclined.   The most failsafe approach is to equip our younger generation with globally recognized achievements (education certificates) and hence they can be competitively relevant should they choose to move out of Singapore.  And at the same time, the average level of academics is increased due to competition among peers, hence singapore can sell itself as a prime investment location with a local academically strong workforce. | 4| 2017-07-21 19:10:49

singapore| DinosaurReborn| Other commentors are exaggerating. Also Amos Yee case is an incredibly isolated incident.   You *could* be charged under whatever law, depending on context, but saying this without explaining why is very alarmist.   For example, if you wrote something like what Dawkins said in the site you link, and posted it in an anonymous account to a site like reddit or forums or social media,  *most likely* you won't get charged. Lots of Singaporeans probably already have done so with zero repurcussions.   Now if you posted this with your real name on normie social media like Facebook or Twitter, you're inviting trouble for yourself. Even if you don't get charged under the law, you risk pissing off Singaporeans and face a PR disaster for your personal reputation. Like Anton Casey who was not charged by any law and yet got self-exiled for saying derogatory things about the general Singaporran public. Court of Law might not have found any wrongdoing, but Court of Public Opinion of the Singaporean Public is a different matter altogether, and Singaporean's collective anger (some would say mob mentality) is surprisingly powerful.   But Anton Casey is yet another isolated incident. Lots of Singaporeans have expressed atheist, pro-religion or anti-religion comments on comments sections and forums, some even with their real name facebook accounts, and did not face any legal repurcussions at all. As long as there isn't much visibility to your potentially controversial comment, there isn't much legal risk.   Anyway, *The God Delusion* by Richard Dawkins is freely sold in mainstream bookstores like Kinokuniya, alongside other atheist-centric books, alongside pro-religion books. | 7| 2017-07-08 17:20:21
singapore| wasteofrice| &gt;(Amos Yee) was sentenced to six weeks' jail and a $2,000 fine in total for eight charges - two for failing to turn up at a police station and six for intending to **wound the feelings of Muslims and/or Christians**.  so yes, in this case making public statements offensive to certain religions can get you charged. which means that the likes of Charlie Hebdo and what OP posted would definitely be dealt with quite severely here, compared to other places.   People will criticize our freedom of speech, but it can't be helped if the government feels there is a need to protect our fragile feelings, after all it's quite obvious by now that religious singaporeans (and people in general) are not the most mature and rational bunch, especially when faced with triggering content involving race/religion. It's like mommy telling the kids 'nothing good to say, don't say', so that they don't fight and cause a mess at home - because at the end of the day the kids who fight aren't the ones who end up having to clean up the mess.| 5| 2017-07-08 17:11:58

singapore| bitflag| &gt; How is that a logical fallacy?  Because saying you are "free to criticize us within the law" when the law restricts your expression makes it sound like you have free speech when you actually don't.  One could as well say "smokers are very free, they can smoke everywhere they want! Within the limits of the law". In every country you are free to do *anything* within the limits of the law, which in the ends means squat.  &gt; our judicial system is based off of pre-existing systems that have been around many times longer than our country has  Which means nothing. Yes it's **based** on English law, but the differences have huge consequences. Democracies (UK included) do not apply the same standard for libel to public figures than anonymous people for example, or have more limited criteria for hate speech (see: Amos Yee). Just because it's based on UK law means it's the same as UK. (duh)| 1| 2017-07-05 09:06:39

singapore| onionguy4| Amos yee wasn't charged with hate speech. He was charged with "offending religious feelings"  The common definition of hate speech involves inciting people to harm the target group or expose them to danger. | 1| 2017-07-03 08:57:03
singapore| starrRiver| I'm not sure if gay marriage has anything to do with hate speech laws. The thing is, Amos Yee was charged under the Sedition Act for speech with seditious tendency, which is a tendency ["to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population of Singapore."](http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=DocId%3A%221f6d9e4b-1cf1-4575-9480-da4bdeff9ef4%22%20Status%3Apublished%20Depth%3A0;rec=0) Even now, without gay marriage, you could argue that "difference classes of people" includes people of different sexual orientation, and hate speech against gay people could conceivable fall under this umbrella. If religious groups openly incite hatred towards gay people, a creative lawyer could already make the argument that this is seditious. Broadly defined anti hate speech provisions can cut both ways.| 3| 2017-07-02 12:50:40

singapore| Cryxtalix| To me, Singaporeans cannot handle criticism well. Many generalise and follow the crowd instead of making up their own minds about issues. Many people in online discussion belittle and harrass opposition instead of countering with their own arguments.  Some examples of dumb ideas. Why is PAP always said to be the bad guy ruining the country? Why is Amos Yee always a stupid fool? Why is SPF always said to be incompetent and unjust? Why is the capital punishment for misuse of drugs always condemned although it has been that way forever?  Many Singaporeans are stuck with a mindset that is not open to change or accepting viewpoints different from the mainstream narrative. To argue against those would set tons of people against you. Singaporeans really need to learn to accept that other view points exist and are as valid as their own.| 26| 2017-06-25 16:28:23

singapore| mikaelus| I haven't lived in SG nearly as long and made friends quite easily. Everything depends on who you're dealing with - and I found most Singaporeans very friendly and quite easy-going - and I mean Singaporeans of all ages. So it's ultimately down to you and the environment you choose to live in.  I've lived in five other countries before and in some I have local friends while in others I don't. But I wouldn't go to extrapolate my experience and say a particular nation is more open than others. It just depends on whom you surround yourself with.  Rents and slimy agents are typical of pretty much all countries in the world. And you may think rents are high, but they really aren't when you compare other big cities. It's just a standard level. Most big American cities are more expensive, as are Australian ones. Tokyo, London, Paris - all in a similar bracket. But you get a lot more city for the money - in terms of living standards and public services.  If you don't follow politics it would be better to consider your comments before making them. Singapore is managing perfectly fine being the hotbed of innovation in Southeast Asia and one of the centers of the entire continent. Innovation doesn't necessarily come from rebels fucking things up. And Singapore is - if you haven't yet noticed - easily the most diverse city in the world which has managed to maintain peace, stability and ultra-low crime on levels unseen anywhere in the developed world. Not to mention that it was elevated from 3rd to 1st world in a matter of 50 years.  And it has all done that precisely because it's really well managed politically. So to come in and say this or that is wrong or this or that will not contribute to its future is simply ignorant of its achievements up to this point - and its continued growth despite crippling global crisis since 2008.  As for Amos Yee - he spent more than six months in American detention - a few times more than he did in Singapore, where out of several weeks spent in remand, half of his sentence was home detention. So who is really mistreating the crazy kid? His case is not about him personally - it's about a dangerous precedent which cannot be allowed in a country this diverse - and, potentially, divided. For the same reasons proselytizing is outlawed and all religions are walled off from each other, so that people don't interfere with matters of personal beliefs of any other person. That's part of the reason Singapore has managed to maintain peace between vastly different cultures - something that no other country in the world achieved.  It's the rest of the world that has a lot to learn from Singapore, not the other way around. | 3| 2017-06-20 16:34:22

singapore| littlefiredragon| &gt; Aside from some nice Indian/Muslim options, hawker center food here is way overrated. It's really oily and bland, usually loaded with sugar, salt or MSG to try and compensate, and just overall unhealthy and not very nice  Can't agree more. The thing is, hawker food originated from the need for sustenance using cheap ingredients. And the cheapest way to make that palatable was to use  lots of oil, sugar, salt, MSG to add flavour and hide the low quality of the food.  I personally avoid most hawker food myself, especially cai png where the same starchy sauces are reused for multiple dishes, which are often left for hours in the open.  &gt; As a coffee lover, I've never seen a large city with such poor cafes: most are expensive, crowded, and uncomfortable. There is nothing relaxing about hanging out in a cafe here at all. And while I enjoy kopi for what it is, sorry - it is not coffee. ducks  Overcrowded and uncomfortable cafes are a byproduct of high rent in a land-scarce country. Good job on saying no to black liquids that taste like burnt rubber!  &gt; Most of your drivers are complete assholes. I've never seen such entitled motorists anywhere else in the developed world. I guess when you pay 3x the value for a car, you can't help but feel like a king that deserves more respect than pedestrians (peasants).  Unfortunate byproduct of a kiasu society.  &gt; Your government's response to Amos Yee did far, far more damage to SG's reputation than he ever could. This is just an outsider's opinion, but if some vulgar kid trolling on the Internet can be such a threat to your 'social stability', that speaks volumes.  Couldn't have said it better.| 3| 2017-06-19 01:03:24
singapore| t722| im not sure how much i believe LHY abt this. sounds like all fart and no shit  so far all LHL has done is release two statements 1. denying everything and expressing sorrow that his siblings chose to escalate and 2. releasing a statement which explains his position (although also implying that LSF and LHY might have committed foul play)  whereas LHY has directly called him a liar, accused him of nepotism and of flagrant abuses of power, insulted his wife, alleged that he is betraying his father's values. and then he says that he is afraid of being monitored, he is being forced to leave the country?  i'm not denying that LHL has both the means as well as the track record of suing his political opponents. he does. but up to now LHL has done literally nothing but explain himself. andactually this whole nonsense started when LHY accused LHL out in the open (also, honestly, if you are hurling accusations of corruption on social media, govt no need to go to whatsapp. see amos yee for an example)  i just feel like LHY is playing up the paranoia and oppression for his own sake. he and LWL did threaten to do that before the 2015 GE after all.| 9| 2017-06-16 22:23:27

singapore| shinigami_88| Stop being such a dick. I blame shits like you for giving atheists such a bad rep. Stop spewing hatred. It's also totally uncalled for given the context.   You want to take a dump on religion, go ahead. There's a subreddit for that. This isn't it. You're not contributing anything to the discussion. In fact, you're derailing it. Someone put something weird in his pillow. If it was you, would you not want to understand the intentions behind it? It could be well wishes or death threats. Only an idiot wouldn't try and find out which, regardless if you believe in religion or magic. The person who put it there exists, and can still cause harm.   Bear in mind you're posting in Singapore. If you are indeed living in Singapore, you're responsible for stuff you post online as well. Or, you can try your luck and post more crap.

singapore| wasteofrice| I feel like trying to use this case as an indicator of the undercurrent of racism towards minorities in Singapore is an uphill task, since *some* will repeatedly deflect the issue and point towards how 'IT'S NOT RACIST IF IT'S ACTING'. Also, it's obvious those people are not ready for a civil discussion on racism in Singapore (beyond this one case), but rather are merely sticking around to defend their point - that "the actor is just playing the victim card, because this is not racism at all!!!".  This case in question is a great opener for a discussion on the can of worms that is the freedom of speech. I believe many of the actor's supporters feel like people should undergo self-censorship (i.e. follow the 'PC culture'), and not say things to 'hurt or discriminate others'. But, personally, I think we should make a distinction here, as a step towards greater freedom of speech - that saying these things *can* be permitted (like how admitting exaggerated Indian accents are funny to some, or Indians have 'a smell' to some) as long as we don't actively exclude them because of that.   We can't be policing people's thoughts and words just because they 'hurt our feelings' (even though the govt has already done that with Amos Yee). I don't think that's something many of us would like in our everyday lives. No one wants to be put under pressure - constantly having to be politically correct or risk being the target of a public mob. We ought to counter hate speech with more speech of our own, not by throwing stones like savages.   So as far as this Shrey and ABTM incident goes, it's all well and good that we're having a "conversation" about how racist this case is (if at all), but everyone should remember that while this one case may or may not be racist in your book, we're not enemies - we're all Singaporeans, so let's be more civil and open to discussion on the wider problems in society.| 10| 2017-05-30 12:13:01

Wellington| Phuzzybear| As someone who has spent near 3 decades in Singapore, I have to urge caution with using Singapore as an example for anything.  There is no free speech and no freedom of press. Demonstrations and protests are not allowed without a permit (which as you may assume is impossible to get.) You WILL be arrested and thrown into jail immediately if you participate in an "unlawful assembly."  It is not the cultural melting pot it pretends to be. Yes there is freedom of religion, as long as you're not a Jehovah's Witness (Their pacifism and aversion to blood transfusions is not compatible with the national policy of mandatory military service for the male population.)  There are Singaporeans fighting for ISIS in the current insurgency in the Philippines for example.  There are laws against "sedition" which you will most assuredly run afoul of if you start protesting in public or "incite unrest," and yes, youtube rants will get you into varying degrees of trouble if you don't immediately comply with their first cease and desist, Google "Amos Yee" for a recent example, I don't agree with much of what comes out of his mouth, but I defend his right to form words into sentences.  Racism is rife and prevalent, and it is no better than the racism that is prevalent in any other developed/first world nation. You're just not allowed to speak about it. Homosexuality is also still illegal, as is pornography, but strangely prostitution is legal, but only if you engage in it, in designated red light districts with a proper license.  The reason we have no bombings and mass rapes, aside from the brands of Islam practiced in SE Asia being not of the Salafi or Wahabi flavours, is there is zero tolerance of any law breaking and more than ample law enforcement resources. The borders are fairly tight, and you can be assured that it is only a matter of time before you're caught.  If you step out of line, the Government can and will bring the might of their legal and law enforcement resources to bear to make you an example, we have very strong deterrent sentencing, and a very unpleasant penal system which is punitive rather than rehabilitative. There is no protection from illegal search and seizure, and there are laws that make law enforcement much easier than in other democratic countries.  The sacrifices made for the relative safety Singapore has established would be unconscionable in Western Democracies.  Additionally, the country is incredibly small (6 million people in an area 70% the size of Auckland) and law enforcement has a very strong and very visible presence. Actual crime is low, so they are free to pursue thought crimes and ensure the population is compliant.  All the little things count, and they are easy to implement in a country this size. Notable examples include no firearms in civilian hands without exceptions, explosive precursors being tightly controlled, e.g. Hydrogen peroxide over 3% concentration, potassium nitrate, ammonium nitrate etc.  Essentially it is incredibly hard to get your hands on materials required for bomb making, coupled with the very high level of statewide surveillance, as well as the very minimal level of influence in global politics all combine to make Singapore an incredibly unattractive target.| 5| 2017-05-29 06:44:06

singapore| wasteofrice| too many baby boomers and religious people in singapore still resistant to change, as they were mostly raised thinking that "gay" was a disease. in the end singapore's stance still stays, and it'll probably be the same old reasons referring to public sentiment, and to avoid 'wounding religious feelings' (the same thing amos yee was charged for).   Someone should just take one for the team, and be honest in parliament - call out these sanctimonious religious leaders to stop caring about 'who marries who', and tell them to instead stick their nose into more pressing issues facing the world/singapore today.| 6| 2017-05-24 20:04:32

singapore| Cryxtalix| Why do Singaporean get so upset about Amos yee? Is there another reason besides their personal religion getting mocked so they get butthurt?   With ISD and laws to arrest any racially or religiously improper words, there are almost no criticisms of race and religion to be found in Singapore, even when there are problems. No one dares to speak up. Amos did. Now he is in the US with asylum granted, and i hope he can continue his work there.  I have nothing against religion. But i think those who get upset are just insecure with themselves. Amos' brand is a little extreme, but satire often brings up problems we would never know otherwise. Like how he gets hundreds of death threats in his videos, these commentors aren't any better themselves.

It's childish and reactionary, meant to bait people into a self-perpetuating cycle by creating the strawmen to fight in future. It goes like   * say something controversial * gets reaction * points to reaction as evidence of PC culture * uses that as justification to say more controversial things  Sounds a lot like Amos Yee to me, it's unproductive.

The_Donald| ztalker2002| Friend, look at my reply again. I said, it has a strict qualification for immigration. What is implied is that, if you dont follow their agenda, BTFO.   "It maintains multi-culturalism..  through force." - I agree. The propanganda of "racial harmony" is strong in this country. I live in Singapore. The only way Singapore is a multicultural is because of a centralized effort of the government to push their agenda. Free speech is impaired (Nguk Ng) and criticism against the norm is persecuted (Amos Yee)  What the previous commentor and I are talking about is the amount of globalism in terms of foreign talent. I agree that the country itself will not thrive without globalism. But at the cost of a controlled racially-driven "diversity".   Singaporeans minority, especially the Malays, get the short end of the stick cause the Chinese majority is scared. They believe that if (and which I completely believe is bullshit), they believe that if a war breaks out with Malaysia or Indonesia, placing a high-ranking Malay officer with similar values may risk national security.

Alors clairement le fait que ce soit une ville sur un petit territoire joue énormément car ça rend le micro management beaucoup plus aisé. Mais ça n'explique pas tout. Déjà la corruption a été éradiqué très vite (c'est un des pays qui a l'indice de perception de corruption le plus faible http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016) mais il y a aussi une vraie culture de l'efficacité des services publiques qui a été très tôt mis en place.

Je pense notamment aux interdictions des durians et des chewing-gums. La consommation/vente de cannabis est-elle passable de mort à Singapour? La bastonnade/rosser à coup de bâton est-il une punition utilisées ou il s'agit de rumeur?  On dit souvent que "Singapore is a fine city" pour jouer sur le double sens du mot fine (agréable/amende). Il y a beaucoups de  [panneaux](https://www.google.com.sg/search?q=singapore+fine+city&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMoIqj2vXTAhWIvY8KHUh5ALYQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=726#tbm=isch&amp;q=singapore+fine) qui viennent rappeler ce qui est illégal de faire dans certaines zones et ça peut faire sourire oui :) Effectivement il n'y a pas le droit des prendre les transports publiques avec du durians (mais si tu connais l'odeur c'est compréhensible) et les chewing gums sont interdit sur l'île oui. En conctrepartie c'est le pays le plus propre que je connaisse. Par contre oui la peine de mort et les bastonade sont pratiqué à Singapour. Pour la peine de mort elle a très fortement [diminué](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peine_de_mort_%C3%A0_Singapour) mais d'une façon générale c'est un pays qui pratique la punition physique (canning) et ce même dans les écoles par les professeurs voir les parents eux même. Il y avait un fil reddit qui discutait du bien fondé des coups de batons dans l'éducation et c'était assez clivant mais on pouvait trouver pas mal de personnes qui le défendait ([ici](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/2syoyp/singaporeans_what_do_you_really_think_about/) ou [là](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/5739cc/who_got_cane_during_secondary_school_times/)).  &gt; Y-a-t-il un centrale électrique à Singapour ou le pays est tributaire d'un voisin pour son électricité?  [L'électricité](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_sector_in_Singapore) à Singapour dépend à 95% de l'import de gaz mais ils ont aussi des usine électrique qui brûlent des déchets. D'une façon générale c'est un pays extrêmement fragile dans la mesure où tout est importé, nourriture, énergies, produits de consommation, c'est trop petit pour avoir tout ça sur l'île. De fait ils entretiennent autant que possible des bonnes relations avec leur voisins mais il y a souvent des petites [tensions](https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/3p07zn/singaporemalaysia_relationship/).    &gt; Y-a-t-il un service militaire?  Oui, obligatoire et qui dure 2 ans. Si tu deviens Singapouréens, tes enfants sont obligés de faire le service comme les autres. Ne pas faire son service en fuyant le pays par exemple est passible de prison. Je pense que la plupart des singapouréens trouvent que c'est un peu une perte de temps.  &gt; Le système de classe/caste dont tu parlais se traduit-il par des inégalités au sein des ethnies? Quelles sont les religions en place?  Les [principales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Singapore) religions sont le bouddhisme, l'hindouisme le christianisme et l'islam et bien sur l'athéisme qui est majoritaire (chez la jeune génération). Les religions/ethnies ne sont pas égales du point de vue de la démographie et la population compte quand même une grande majorité de personnes d'origine chinoise. Je ne saurais pas trop te dire comment sont réparties les inégalités car la pauvreté n'est pas vraiment visible. Il n'y a pas de caste ni de système de classe à proprement parler (quand je parlais de violence de classe je parlais de l'extrême inégalité entre riche et pauvre mais il n'y a pas de statut) mais il y a des quotas pour harmoniser les populations au sein des HDB. Tout les singapouréens ont droit à l'éducation et contrairement à la malaisie qui pratique l'affirmative action (qui est par ailleurs un [échec](http://www.worldpolicy.org/blog/2016/04/12/positive-discrimination-perspectives-malaysia)), il n'y a rien de tel à Singapour qui est avant tout méritocratique. Le système des quotas dans les HDB font qu'il n'y a pas de ghettos ethnique et pour autant que je sache tout les quartiers se valent à peu près en terme de propreté, sécurité, accès à l'éducation.  &gt; Y-a-t-il un "Président à vie" dont on ne peut pas se moquer, càd pas de caricatures, sketchs télévisés satyriques?  La liberté de la presse est quasi nulle (classement [RSF](https://rsf.org/en/singapore) 151/180) donc on ne peut se moquer de personne :) tu ne trouveras pas d'équivalent des guignols et il n'y a pas de presse qui se moque de l'état et c'est d'ailleurs interdit. Un jeune singapouréen bloger et [youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/user/BrainAndButter), Amos Yee, a récemment fait un peu de [prison](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/teen-blogger-amos-yee-gets-six-weeks-jail-and-2000-fine-for-wounding) pour une vidéo youtube où il avait dessiné Lee Kuan Yew (le père fondateur de Singapour un peu le charles de gaulle singapouréen en terme de symbole, mort il y a deux ans) dans une position très explicite et dans cette même vidéo il critiquait les religions. Il est souvent assez violent dans ses vidéos et pas particulièrement fin (il est pour la liberté d'expression absolu) mais du coup il l'a payé assez cher. Il s'est depuis [exhilé](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/05/us-release-singaporean-blogger-amos-yee) aux USA où il est détenu depuis son arrivé. La démocratie à Singapour n'en a que le nom, il y a effectivement des partis d'opposition (comme le Worker's Party) mais comme la liberté de la presse est extrêmement restreinte on n'entend pas leur arguments. Les manifestations et rassemblements publiques étant également interdit c'est difficile pour eux d'exister sur la scène politique publique. Quelques semaines avant les [élections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Singapore) (tout les 6 ans), les rallyes sont autorisés (très contrôlés) mais ce n'est évidemment pas suffisant pour convaincre. Je pense que la politique à Singapour en terme de débats d'idée se fait plus à la chinoise c'est à dire de façon interne au parti où il existe certainement plusieurs courant mais le publique n'est pas vraiment sollicité, les singapouréens ne sont de toutes façon pas du tout politisé et ont une grande confiance dans leur leaders politique. Le président a un rôle purement symbolique et ne sert à rien, c'est le premier ministre qui a le pouvoir actuellement Lee Hsien Loong le fils de Lee Kuan Yew.  &gt; Désolé, ça fait beaucoup, mais je suis super curieux. Ça fait société alternative à mes yeux comme tu le racontes.  C'est vraiment une société assez étonnante. Ça fait 3 ans que j'y vis et la société continue de me surprendre dans une sorte de mélange dystopie/utopie à la brave new world où tout est bien organisé et fonctionne correctement (enfin pour moi qui a les moyens d'y vivre) mais où tu as l'impression que t'es un peu comme endormi. Heuresement qu'il y a la politique française pour me donner ma dose quotidienne de stimulus politique :) Mais effectivement vivre ici m'a challengé à peu près tout ce que je croyais avant de venir et ça a été une vraie claque pour moi qui suis par exemple un militant pour la liberté d'expression (je le suis toujours) et la dissonance cognitive n'est pas tout les jours facile, mais ça m'a fait réaliser que tout est possible et que l'idéologie compte souvent moins que la façon dont les choses sont exécutés.   Je sais que je m'habitue un peu trop à ce confort car chaque fois que je voyage dans les pays aux alentours (indonésie, malaysie) je suis vite rappelé ce que c'est qu'un pays où la corruption rampante et l'inefficacité politique produit comme résultat, c'est sale, stressant et désagréable, tu te fais entuber à chacunes de tes interactions et j'ai toujours ce petit sentiment quand l'avion se pose à singapour et le taxi me ramène chez moi où je me dis "il fait quand même bon vivre à singapour". Un mec m'a dit une fois "Singapore: it is hard to love but hard to hate".| 2| 2017-05-17 09:48:08

legaladviceofftopic| MajorPhaser| Amos Yee was granted asylum because he fled a country with harsh restrictions on speech used to quell political dissent.  He was initially targeted and punished for skewering the government, not an individual or group.  They *claimed* he targeted Christians, but he was going after the former head of state.  So if you can prove that your conviction was pretext to quell political dissent in your home country, you'd have a shot.  But if you were *actually* spewing hate about a specific group of people, you won't.  I'm using "conviction" here as a shorthand for "Actually did the thing you're accused of"| 1| 2017-05-12 03:58:25
legaladviceofftopic| Okamibin| Well I disagree that is what it would mean but it certainly isn't settled and people for example Amos Yee have claimed asylum due to hate speech convictions despite the fact you think this would make them a persecutor.| 1| 2017-05-12 03:49:03

singapore| bluesblue1| There's two ways of dealing with this, just apologise and take down the post and hope that the teacher, principle and moe stop pursuing. Or you could fight for your rights. Despite the lack of freedom of speech, as long as your content was not slanderous to the point of Amos Yee, I doubt it you will get it trouble for it. Use your followers, tell the world what is happening and how the school is abusing their powers to oppress students, get your followers to share it far and wide.| 5| 2017-05-09 05:19:17
singapore| delta_p_delta_x| &gt;great minds  &gt; Roy Ngerng and Amos Yee  Erm, sure, I'll take your word on that. What have they said and done that make you say they have 'great minds', unless I'm missing some sarcasm here? | 3| 2017-05-07 23:18:48
singapore| luacs1998| I tend to sort "liberalism" as seen in Singapore into 3 groups:  1. The center-left 2. The "let's run this country ~~into the ground~~ like the US" liberals 3. everyone else  The first group would join the PAP and drink the PAP Kool-Aid, in time becoming conservative center-right wingers.  The second group consist of great minds like Roy Ngerng and Amos Yee, whom arguably due to poor messaging and simply being too radical for the public to stomach end up as roadside jesters. Some of the more moderate ones make up our opposition, though.  The third group are the poor buggers who end up as the "staff" in the "Disneyland" that is SG. It would not be a stretch to say that these people's thought processes are like, I may not like how the country is run, but I keep my head down because I need my paycheck.  It's just that anything not fitting the circlejerk idea of "liberalism" espoused by the third groups just ends up in the second group, a catch-all for "troublemakers" that the PAP has very cleverly used to their advantage.  Hence, it's not exactly popular to overly question the status quo, unless you want to look like an anarchist nutcase.| 3| 2017-05-07 16:36:31
Brunei| King-of-D| Thunderf00t, Cult of Dusty, Amos Yee, and some other Internet Personalities I have visited have beef with Islamic Religion. How I managed to find their channel or why is not really that important, but I'm truly curious if anyone has ever stumble upon internet personalities who are quite Islamophobes or even criticizing the religion altogether. I want to see how you would react to such situation.  As a man of religion (Not really religious, tbh), I was supposedly offended by such acclamation, but there is a part of me that agrees with them, well, unless they provide factual or even credible sources, I would consider it, but actions made by Amos Yee for example, well, I wouldn't like that obviously, that doesn't mean I should voice out my frustration. I believe, it's more wiser to just ignore jeers rather than retaliate, because no outcome would be good, and plus, we don't even know if they know 100% of the faith.  Main point is, to what extent your curiosity would take you, even if you acknowledged that the content could be offensive to your cultural society. Would you still continue to watch it? I for one, admittedly watched it but just for the shits and giggles, and possibly even raising some hormones.  Other words, it's odd that I find it quite entertaining to see offensive contents, but I'll be at my limit if there are contents that involves animal cruelty, that is my Achilles Heel.  Just for an instance here's an [example video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ji0V6Ao-C8). and the title is "Muslim Logic Fail" by Natetalktoyou.  I may consider that as a "social experiment", I actually want to know how would you feel, especially when it involves roasting your faith. No offense is intended.| 5| 2017-05-07 11:33:41

(i can see the downvotes coming from triggered singaporeans already - "*anything positive about amos yee is blasphemy!*")| 61| 2017-05-06 23:21:18
singapore| pingdragon| &gt;Nobody here is asking for freedom to indulge in hate speech.  Naturally and Singapore's freedom of speech laws ONLY condemn hate speech and false accusations. I've never seen an article that was taken down that does not include said reasons.   &gt;wheres your source that people in Singapore want freedom to indulge in hate speech? You claim the majority want this freedom to participate in hate speech.  If a racist little shit wanted to make noise by publishing a racist article and was taken down by the government what do u think his next course of action will be? Use free speech as a fking excuse. That is exactly what Amos Yee did. | 2| 2017-05-06 02:06:00
singapore| pingdragon| &gt;When IBs talk about press freedom.and freedom of speech they immediately assume it is hate speech.   It is quite funny u pointed that out. Most ppl who use the mah freedom o speech excuse are the ones trying to incite religious tensions and sow discord (Amos Yee) aka hate speech. Yet there are still articles published critiquing religions in Singapore and are not taken down by the government because it is NOT hate speech. Cases which have hate speech involved in Sg have little to no controversy behind it; no sane person can defend the accused actions.   &gt; This reasoning has been used by government propaganda to justify curtailing our rights.  Again, rights to use hate speech? Coz as far i can tell, hate speeches and false accusations in Sg are the ones being condemned.   &gt;why aren't the top few countries ranked for press and individual freedom in total disarray like you predicted? Answer this question. I challenge you since you claim to be an independent thinker. All developed countries are highly ranked except for Singapore in this regard.  Damn... u are awfully ignorant. U talk as if the situation in Singapore is exactly like the ones faced in other countries. Remember i said "give me some examples that complete "individual and press freedom" has lead to a prosperous and successful MULTICULTURAL nation" notice the word "multicultural" in CAPS. So tell me which MULTICULTURAL country with at least 3 major races and religion living together in harmony? There are many factors that affect the fall and rise of the nation and every country is different, a policy that work very well in a country DOES NOT necessary mean it will work just as well in another country. History has tell us time and time again what will and cannot work for a certain society, there is a bloody reason why history is one of the more respected subjects in academia especially in political sciences. Seriously, u should know this or are u just swallowing and regurgitating what u heard coz it sounded good on paper without thinking?   That said, all countries in the top few rankings also have a certain level control over free speech. The whole of Europe would condemn you if u denial clearly established historical facts like the Holocaust and broadcasting NAZI propaganda. So are u gonna bash the Europeans now? Also, defamation and slander lawsuits are LEGAL IN ALL COUNTRIES that have a functioning legal system, yes including USA, shocker right? That in itself inhibits the notion of free speech. Hell even Trump is doing it too, by silencing victims of his Trump "University" by forcing them to sign a contract that prevents them from disclosing the truth of his "university" over a sum of money (u gotta understand that his victims come from low to low-mid income families). So tell me again, which developed country practice complete freedom of speech that is not hindered by government? U r a sad sad bloke thinking that other countries have your vision of free speech.   &gt;Maybe you are just propagating government lies?  And how to do u know your views and ideology are correct n would work? We dun live in black and white world dumbass, it is all shades of grey. There will be consequences no matter what you decide, good and bad. If u can't identify and weigh not just pros but the cons of a policy, u are NOT fit to spout your ideologist nonsense in the first place. U always have to sacrifice sth in return, so what do u want to sacrifice? Safety or freedom?   I am not delusional enough to think that the Sg government, hell governments in general, is pure and true to its people coz a government like that would destroy their country within the 1st month. What i will say is that as long as the government contributes and govern the people well (low crime rate, educated populace, able to feed the citizens, etc), i would not have an issue with it as something has to be done right in the governments part to ensure we have this quality of life. However, as all thing, QOL can be improved, that is where constructive criticism governed by the free speech laws of a country comes in.| 2| 2017-05-05 15:03:35
singapore| wasteofrice| a valid point. I get that we're nothing special. still, other places having a greater or similar level of safety does not detract from the inherent value of our own - and I don't think there's anything wrong with appreciating that.    Anyway, I was just trying to point out that with singapore appearing in sensationalised articles regarding our freedom of speech (eg amos yee issue), foreigners might have a warped opinion of Singapore - as being a place with a lot of restrictions on 'freedom to x", and they might not appreciate the fact that we also have a respectable 'freedom from y' which *some* places don't. That's all there is to it, just an opinion on how foreigners might perceive us if they only rely on popular news. All I had in mind was that foreigners might think Singapore has no redeeming features, when the odds are it would be safer than their town (even though, yes, there are many places that are also safe). | 2| 2017-05-04 17:13:30
mildlyinteresting| MagnusTheGreat| Ok, my gf is from there, her family is from there, she's lived there her entire life, her grandma was almost raped by Japanese soldiers, I've lived there for a few months over the course of a couple of years and I'm going again soon.   Maybe I need more experience?  Also, instead of saying "lol, yur rong", maybe be a mature adult and say *what* is wrong. And will you tell me that Amos Yee was not prosecuted, that kids were not beaten with canes (until relatively recently), that you won't get fined for smoking in public (or that Singapore is trying to limit smoking all together) that littering gives you 500 dollar fine (sgd) and that housing is really expensive (nearly 6 million people in a tiny place tend to drive prices up, not to mention that cars are fantastically expensive [at least compared to Iceland and the US]).  And will you also tell me that Singapore is not one of the safest cities in the world, that LKY dragged Singapore into the modern era, that Singapore had a bombing in one of their MRT stations (I think it was in the early 2000's or the 90's) or that kids don't commit suicide because they fail important exams...  And if it isn't a dictatorship, then tell me please why Singapore has a party with a huge majority of the seats, but around 70% of the population support.   Oh, and my gf's parents bought an apartment for like 2 million SGD (about 120-140 square meters). I could buy 2000 square meters of housing in Iceland (although outside the city, probably around 1000 in the city) and Iceland's housing market is absurd.   Please correct me on the things I am wrong about, cause even if everything is wrong, no one will know what is, cause you are a cunt that just says "WRONG!". Like an immature child.   Oh, and I wanted a bed once in a dorm(around 6 beds), it was 35 dollars per night. I pay that much for an apartment in the middle of Reykjavík...| 1| 2017-05-03 03:45:31

mildlyinteresting| theonlykami123| Glad you asked.  There are many things wrong with this country, and I won't say that it is purely based on judging the government.  the lack of care for the elderly - Sure, CPF and the topic of the post does highlight how well the government 'cares' for the elderly. What I see is the old grandma of 68 years, working as a cleaner with similar people at the coffee shop near my residence. Its revolting to see the government do nothing.  COE - a price to pay to take up roadspace? under the guise of preventing congestion and saving the environment? Even I can think of better ways to circumvent this issue without the need for the citizen to pay for my political campaign, or my salary.  Military - As an NSman who is forced to served in this damned country, I know very well what the army is founded upon, and what principles it tries to instill into the citizen who faces mandatory enlistment. Some of it includes the necessary brainwashing through rigorous chanting of values and whatnot.   Information - I won't delve very deep into this topic because of my lack of understanding, but from what I know, every major news outlet in Singapore is either directly or indirectly linked to people who hold positions in the government. I don't know what this means to you, but it certainly does mean a lot of censorship and carefully placed propaganda in the free 'The New Paper' that's handed out every morning at the local MRT.   Censorship and dissentment - Take Amos yee for example. Was his right to express what he feels wrong? I personally do not take offense to what he says, even if it does not align with my own personal values and thoughts. Persecuting him under section 298 of the penal code for wounding religious feelings is flat out unreasonable.  There are many more I can list. | 1| 2017-04-30 22:56:09

However, he remained in detention pending the appeal. &gt;  &gt; There will be no full hearing of the appeal; instead it will be a review of written documents. &gt;  &gt; “We’ll be submitting to the Board of Immigration Appeals a written memorandum outlining our arguments why this is a valid asylum case" his attorney Chris Keeler, from the firm Grossman Law, told The Straits Times. &gt;  &gt; "The government would say why it is not, and the Board will make their decision based on the written memorandums which are due by May 11.” &gt;  &gt; ## [[LINK: amos.jpg]](http://www.straitstimes.com/files/amosjpg) &gt;  &gt; [[Amos Yee arriving at the State Courts, on Aug 17, 2016. ]](http://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2017/03/25/amos.jpg?itok=KIST5JSx) &gt;  &gt; Related Story &gt;  &gt; #### [[LINK: US judge grants Amos Yee's asylum request]](http://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/us-judge-grants-amos-yees-asylum-request) &gt;  &gt; Mr Keeler said it was difficult to predict how long the process would take after the Board received the written arguments. “My estimate would be a month, or month and a half, but it could be a lot shorter or longer, it depends on what’s going on in the Board,” he told The Straits Times by phone. &gt;  &gt; The decision of the Board could still be appealed by either party in a federal court, Mr Keeler said. &gt;  &gt; Further, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has the authority to hold an asylum seeker until their immigration decision is final, and as long as an appeal is pending it is not final. &gt;  &gt; Mr Yee thus faces potentially months more in detention. Grossman Law has made several appeals to get him released, to no avail. &gt;  &gt; The appeal was not unusual, the attorney said. But he added “we were a little surprised” because “we think it’s a fairly straightforward case that Mr Yee was persecuted in Singapore, that the immigration judge laid out very well” in March. &gt;  &gt; Mr Yee understood the procedure and was fairly confident in his position, Mr Keeler said. &gt;  &gt; But his case could be caught up in larger changes in the attitude towards immigration in the US. &gt;  &gt; “He’s been detained in the US as an asylum seeker longer than he was detained in Singapore, and I think that says a lot about the US immigration system at the moment” Mr Keeler said. &gt;  &gt; “Previously, the ICE had a written policy that once an immigration judge grants asylum, the asylum seeker would be released from detention even if there was a government appeal. But Amos has not been released.” &gt;  &gt; “There hasn’t been a written change but it’s something we have seen in Amos’ case and some others as well.So in that way, I suppose things are tightening up." &gt;  &gt; In general, the US continues to detain people who are fleeing persecution in their countries. This is a good example of how our immigration system is failing those people we need to protect.”   === ^Created ^by ^[/u/Flare](http://reddit.com/user/LFlare)!  _[^[About ^Me]](https://redd.it/61xl9z) [^[Feedback]](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=LFlare&amp;subject=[RedditNewsPostBot%20-%20https://redd.it/67kqop]%20) [^[Source ^Code]](https://github.com/LFlare/redditnewspostbot)_| 1| 2017-04-26 08:39:03
singapore| RedditNewsPostBot| **Extracted Article:**  &gt; SINGAPORE  — US government attorneys are appealing a Chicago immigration judge's decision to grant asylum to Amos Yee. &gt;  &gt; That means 18-year-old Yee remains in US custody. The judge concluded in March that Yee had a "well-founded fear" of being persecuted upon return to Singapore. He was first detained by US immigration authorities in December at O'Hare International Airport. &gt;  &gt; Yee's attorney Chris Keeler said Tuesday (April 25) that the case is now before the Board of Immigration Appeals. A final decision could take months. &gt;  &gt; The Department of Homeland Security declined comment Tuesday. &gt;  &gt; Immigration and Customs Enforcement didn't immediately have comment. &gt;  &gt; An ICE online database shows Yee is detained at a Wisconsin jail.

singapore| ha1fhuman| So many sympathizers for him. For me, that's a fuck no. He's had at least 20 years to do something productive, hone some skills (even if that skill is useless as fuck), or even take up comedian classes. Heck, even Amos Yee had some talent in being eloquent for his age and is well-practiced in critical thinking (albeit being convoluted in thinking)  But hell no, all that is too much hardwork; he'd rather screw around and become a joke, garner fame not from [achievements, skill or talent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famous_for_being_famous), but by being a total jackass.  Edit: Now that I think of it, this is exactly like AMDK vs Sinkie, except in reverse.  AMDK beg for money to travel the world: Wtf u chao angmoh, got leg got hands still so entitled, begging on the streets for what?! Go find a proper job  Sinkie pull some stunts and ask for money: Oh poor thing, 40+ year old already still no job no life, must have some kind of personality disorder.  Hypocrisy much?

Brunei| Ron_Paul_2024| As you can see, I have gotten a lot of downvotes because a lot of people here have bought into the long term lies about North Korea. Yes they do have an strict and oppressive regime, but they are in a state of war, and could not afford to have internal dissent among its people and they know the USA is active in doing espionage work. If you want to be a tourist and visit North Korea, you will be safe as long as you really are trying to be a tourist and not a political asshole or doing the no-nos of every country.  Most of the bad thing we all heard about North Korea are usually through Western Media and the Korean defectors. However, don't forget, Amos Yee was able to portray Singapore as an "oppressive" country to people in the USA, who has never been to Singapore.   So I will take it with a grain of salt. Whenever, I mention North Korea to my peers and family, they said the same negative things, but then what were their "source", its usually via the Western Media.  That is why, a lot of redditors are cool with the US nuking North Korea, because a lot of people have been manipulated to not going to North Korea or seeing the majority of North Korea as normal humans beings.   As for source, can you please just type North Korea in youtube, there are numerous news about North Korea. There have been people going to North Korea and vlogging about it, some are objective, while others also try to make it look worse than it is, to get positive comments from ignorant people and get views for their channel.  | -1| 2017-04-18 12:47:29

singapore| WoodenSwordsman| Duterte burned the flag in 1995 over Flor Contemplacion, and made remarks about doing it again during his election after our Embassy in Manila clarified our govt doesn't endorse any candidate after the fake facebook post came out.  2014, Vietnam burned our flag at Viet-Sing joint industrial parks as part of anti-China protest. Some evidence to suggest they just conflated us with China and weren't actually aiming us.  In 2015, HK civil group protesting to release Amos Yee from remand, burnt effigies of LKY and LHL, not our flag iirc. May be less/more offensive depending on how you take it.  A few months back some local dude instagrammed himself burning the flag and dared the govt to give him death penalty. I don't think anything came out of that, but if anything he'd be fined.  I can't find anything on a HKer tearing up the flag at embassy in 90s though. Would also like to know more if anyone remembers. (Complete speculation: maaaybe related to Shiu Chi Ho getting caned and jailed along with Michael Fay? Pled non-guilty, alleged coerced confession. Might be enough for family member to tear flag cos' of injustice. Just a guess)| 15| 2017-04-16 01:15:58

singapore| starrRiver| Perhaps you personally see mockery of religion as something that is protected as free speech in Europe, as do most of the people you know in Europe, but the fact remains that [the laws above have been enforced in the past](http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Hate_speech_ENG.pdf) against speech that are not very different from what Amos Yee said about muslims as reported in OP's link. [Examples are also documented here.](http://www.legal-project.org/issues/european-hate-speech-laws) These are cases that have either passed muster or gone unchallenged before the ECHR.  Some examples selected from the links:  1. A belgian MP was convicted for distributing leaflets saying "“Stand up against the Islamification of Belgium”, “Stop the sham integration policy” and “Send non-European job-seekers home" 2. Le Pen (father of the one of the frontrunners in the upcoming french election) was convicted for saying in an interview that “the day there are no longer 5 million but 25 million Muslims in France, they will be in charge”. 3. In 2008, actress Brigitte Bardot was haled into court and convicted on charges of inciting racial hatred for her criticism concerning the ritual slaughter of sheep during a Muslim feast. Bardot was ordered to pay €15,000, the fifth time she was fined for inciting racial hatred against Muslims since 1997.  Now you don't have to agree with how these laws are applied. I'm sure many Europeans don't. In fact I too personally think that Singapore's hate speech laws are too harsh. What I find slightly annoying is this pretence that Singapore's legal policy towards hate speech is somehow qualitatively different from these amazing liberal free-speech loving western countries, when in reality Singapore, like Europe, face similar problems with trying to strike a good balance between hate speech protection and freedom of expression. | 9| 2017-04-15 15:29:42

In 2015, Mr Yee insulted Christians, saying Jesus Christ was 'power hungry and malicious' and 'full of bull'. &gt;  &gt; "Last year, he said: 'The Islamics seem to have lots of sand in their vaginas… But don't mind them, they do after all follow a sky wizard and a paedophile prophet. What in the world is a 'moderate Muslim'? A f*****g hypocrite, that's what!'" &gt;  &gt; She added: "The Economist may agree with the American judge that such bigotry is free speech. But Singapore does not countenance hate speech, because we have learnt from bitter experience how fragile our racial and religious harmony is. Several people have been prosecuted for engaging in such hate speech." &gt;  &gt; Yee was charged in 2015 for engaging in hate speech against Christians in a video he posted on YouTube, and for publishing an obscene image. He was convicted and given a four-week jail sentence. &gt;  &gt; Last year, he was charged again for hate speech against Muslims and Christians. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment and a $2,000 fine. &gt;  &gt; In December last year, he sought asylum in the United States, and succeeded last month. &gt;  &gt; A Chicago immigration judge, in granting the 18-year-old asylum, had said in a 13-page judgment that he was persecuted for his political opinion. &gt;  &gt; The Economist suggested this was unusual, as immigration judges often granted asylum with a "simple, spoken ruling". &gt;  &gt; It described Yee's online posts as "a profanity-laced video... calling Lee 'a horrible person', an 'awful leader' and a 'dictator'", and said Yee had mocked Christianity for only about 30 seconds in the 519-second video. &gt;  &gt; The weekly publication also noted a response by the Association of Criminal Lawyers of Singapore that had said the US judge's findings were "baseless and unwarranted". &gt;  &gt; Citing it, The Economist said: "Saying such things about a ruling of a Singaporean court, ironically, could put the speaker at risk of prosecution for contempt." &gt;  &gt; In her letter, Ms Foo said that contrary to the suggestion, Singapore's laws on contempt do not prevent fair criticism of court judgments. &gt;  &gt; She said that The Economist article itself demonstrates this. &gt;  &gt; "Singapore's court judgments, including Mr Yee's case, are reasoned and published, and can stand scrutiny by anyone, including The Economist," she said.   === ^Created ^by ^[LFlare](/u//LFlare)!  _[^[About ^Me]](https://redd.it/61xl9z) [^[Feedback]](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=LFlare&amp;subject=[RedditNewsPostBot%20-%20https://redd.it/65gcu8]%20) [^[Source ^Code]](https://github.com/LFlare/redditnewspostbot)_| 7| 2017-04-15 08:45:11

My sympathy is with the victims, not the criminal.   edit: Also to point out, the kneejerk response isn't to lock up someone with mental issues. It's to lock up someone who's physically abusing people who did nothing to deserve it. Would people want to lock up people with mental issues who haven't broken the law? No. Your assumption is just way off. | 16| 2017-04-06 13:52:41

singapore| iloveincongruity| Amendments to Singapore’s Public Order Act adopted by its parliament give police and other officials broad and arbitrary powers to further limit or ban public assemblies and protests, said Amnesty International today.  As of 3 April, organizers of public events will have to adhere to strict measures including applying for a permit at least 28 days in advance and informing the police of the estimated size of the gathering. Failure to do so will result in a fine of SGD $20,000 or imprisonment for up to a year, or both.   “Our key concern is that the authorities will use the added powers granted by this law to further curtail freedom of expression and peaceful assembly in a country where government critics and activists are already heavily controlled,” said Josef Benedict, Deputy Director for Southeast Asia at Amnesty International.  “The Singaporean government must ensure that the human rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression are enjoyed by all, instead of using new laws and other mechanisms to violate these rights.”  Under the revised Act, police and a government minister will have wide discretion to cancel, postpone or move events. An application for a permit may also be rejected if the police deem that a public meeting will be used for a political purpose and be attended, organized or funded, in any way by foreign nationals.  These latest amendments follow a government clampdown on free speech and public assembly, which has included the conviction and fining of political activist Han Hui Hui for leading a peaceful protest and “causing a public nuisance”, and threats to charge her under wide-ranging contempt of court laws, unless she removed social media posts criticising her trial and punishment.  Background  The Public Order Act, first promulgated in 2009, regulates public talks, religious assemblies and political protests.   In February, a fine of SGD $3,100 (USD $2,281), was imposed against political activist and government critic Han Hui Hui for the peaceful exercise of her right to freedom of expression. This prevents her from standing in the next parliamentary election. The fine followed a peaceful demonstration she organised at Hong Lim Park in 2014, protesting the use of government pension funds.   Last month teenager Amos Yee, who had been jailed twice for blog posts, was granted asylum in the USA, after a US immigration judge ruled that his treatment by Singapore authorities amounted to ‘political persecution’.| 7| 2017-04-05 15:07:48

singapore| be_all_my_sins| The usage of 'hate speech' has commonly been used to refer to some of what Amos Yee says, but I honestly think that it applies also to the very people pouring vitriol on him online. I'm not against those criticizing Amos Yee. My opinion is that it's not an intolerance of what he did, but of the way (some) Singaporeans brought themselves down to his level by expressing their discontent in a way that isn't really different from hate speech. | 9| 2017-04-03 22:21:43

singapore| WANG_BA_DAN| &gt; I don't get why aren't people losing their shit like they did with Amos.  Because the Imam is Muslim. People are happy to get mad about a puny Chinese boy, but they tread more carefully around a Muslim religious leader.   Yes, 99.9% of Muslims are wonderful, moderate people, probably kinder and more compassionate than the average Singaporean. But if the Imam says I'm an infidel who needs to be sent to hell, what if there's one madman who's willing to comply?  Nobody seriously thinks Amos Yee can convince people to murder on his behalf. The Imam, though? Most people wouldn't risk it.| 8| 2017-04-03 19:31:43

The hallmark of that is not to prosecute any individual whose expression threatens the peace. Rather, society should strive to be able to resist any fracturing due to offensive speech. Instead of a public witch hunt, Singapore should respond by simply ignoring the offensive content, and moving on as a society. &gt;  &gt; We cannot purge the Internet of all offensive content.

singapore| nova9001| I understand that it is important to have people who disagree with the system. However, rather then disagree for the sake of being an opposition, we need people who can come up with good solutions to the problems.  The recent asylum seeking by Amos Yee and Han Hui Hui seems to imply they lack the ability to form a credible opposition. Even after following their arguments I come to the conclusion that Amos Yee is basically ranting with no clear goal in mind and HHH's goal is a mystery to me.  Basically, to be an opposition in Singapore, capability is a must. In fact given that you will be fighting against those with significant resources, this individual must be even more capable than the average person. But if there's such a capable person, why would they be fighting against the system rather than being a part of it?| 5| 2017-04-03 11:17:54

Ms Han who contested in the 2015 General Election as an independent candidate was recently flagged by the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) for making scurrilous statements on social media in contempt of court. She later apologised and removed the statements. &gt;  &gt; Ms Han was formerly a Malaysian, and was granted the Singapore citizenship in 2010. The public took notice of the her after she got _[[LINK: embroiled in a dispute with the Council of Private Education]](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/blogger-withdraws-stat-board-challenge) &gt;  &gt; _. But she rose to prominence only after championing the CPF protests she organised with co-activist Roy Ngerng. At one such protest, Ms Han, Mr Ngerng and four others were arrested on 27 September 2014 for organising an illegal protest and for causing a public nuisance. She duly convicted and fined for the offence. &gt;  &gt; &gt; ###### **“I grew up in Singapore and went through their education system. In 2008, I went to college and started a blog. In my blog I talked about the education system and questioned why we are taking so many exams and what the exams are for. Later in 2010, I had my first lawsuit for criticising the education system. Initially they started off by sending school lecturers and school CEOs to sue me for defamation, but they lost. Then in 2013, the government couldn’t take it anymore, they used taxpayers’ money to sue me for defamation. The case was set aside by the court because it is wrong due to freedom of speech. The suit ended in 2013 when the government offered me S$20,000 and the issue subsequently died down. All this is because I exposed degree mills in Singapore. Many foreigners are using degrees they bought from degree mills to get jobs in Singapore while Singaporeans are having a hard time getting jobs.The issue was a hot topic in August 2013 but it died down and recently, it became a hot issue again due to rising unemployment.** &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; ###### **Singapore has many new citizens. In Singapore, about 70,000 people are jobless and yet they (the government) accept more than 10,000 new citizens every year. It started in 2001 with 10,000 new citizens and then it increased up to 20,000 annually over the years. In November 2013, I organised an event on education and every month after that, I organised different events. We also organise trips such as a trip to Norway to find out about their education and political systems but not as a group because we are not allowed to form non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that are not pro-government.” – ’10 things about: Han Hui Hui, the Singaporean social activist’, [[LINK: Malay Mail Online, 31 May 2015]](http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/10-things-about-han-hui-hui-the-singaporean-social-activist) &gt;  &gt; ** &gt;  &gt; In February this year, Ms Han alleged that the Singapore Prisons Services mistreated her when she was in the prison lock-up during her temporary custody for the hearing of the CPF protest. The Ministry of Home Affairs later dismissed her allegations of prison treatment as ‘baseless and false’. &gt;  &gt; Several international human rights organisations, like the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), had called on the Singapore Government to stop the “[[LINK: judicial harassment]](http://www.theindependent.sg/singapore-government-should-end-judicial-harassment-of-han-hui-hui-and-co-accused-fidh/) &gt;  &gt; ” against Ms Han. &gt;  &gt; Mr Leong did not disclose at which European country Ms Han will be seeking asylum in but he said that he wisher her well. he described her as “the bravest girl that I have met and she “fights” in ways that we never would have imagined.” &gt;  &gt; If Mr Leong’s is right, Ms Han would be the second person to seek asylum in recent times. In December last year, teen blogger Amos Yee sought and was eventually granted asylum in the United States of America.   === ^Created ^by ^[LFlare](/u//LFlare)!  _[^[About ^Me]](https://redd.it/61xl9z) [^[Feedback]](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=LFlare&amp;subject=[RedditNewsPostBot%20-%20https://redd.it/62ytvy]%20) [^[Source ^Code]](https://github.com/LFlare/redditnewspostbot)_| 16| 2017-04-02 17:38:51

singapore| gdbGamer| Amos Yee can be held for a potential appeal because of some of the special circumstances of his case. When he landed at Chicago O'Hare airport he asked for asylum immediately from the ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) Officer. Consequently, he was never "admitted" to the United States, and he is still an "arriving alien." As an arriving alien, he has much fewer rights than if he had already been admitted. If he had waited for the ICE Officer to stamp his passport and then declared asylum, his legal situation would be different. As an arriving alien, Judge Cole's order granting Amos Yee asylum is not final until the "appeal period" has passed. The appeal period is 30 days after the judgment. If the DHS files an appeal within the appeal period (as they seem likely to do), then they can ask to continue to hold Amos Yee while the appeal is pending. The commentary [here](http://immigrationcourtside.com/tag/judge-samuel-cole/) explains the situation.| 8| 2017-03-31 01:34:30
singapore| Luo_Yi| I can't think of any reason for DHS to care about Amos Yee either, but there have been a lot of incidents recently of over-reactions by immigration.  Possibly DHS has been given some new general mandates on dealing with refugees and asylum seekers so that might have triggered their interest.| 5| 2017-03-30 19:58:11
singapore| penguinQP| &gt; Yeah but the Department of Homeland Security was created to deal with exceptional circumstances and they are outside the "normal laws". So if they are involved now you can expect that the normal laws will not necessarily be followed.  I suppose that's similar to the sort of discretion that the ISD has. Though I hardly think that Amos Yee can be considered a threat to national security, he's just an annoying kid. The whole thing just reeks of a lack of due process.  The irony is that this is the *exact* sort of thing that Singapore gets flak for. I suppose the liberals would have an explanation for this (Trump), and the fact is that we truly live in different times, but the irony still remains.| 11| 2017-03-30 14:54:13

asianamerican| zasbert| This is Amos Yee  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JqLm1kXqvo  Lee Kuan Yew is arguably the greatest statesman of the 20th century.  He was a key influence in producing a modern, thriving Chinese majority society that people like Deng Xiaoping could see and model a path for China to follow after Mao's death.  Try to understand how difficult it is to run a first world society in a Muslim dominated region, and so appealing that even first world Westerners choose to immigrate there.  This doesn't mean the kid can't have his own opinions, but Singapore was built off of first principles.  LKY didn't have other societal models that he could simply copy.  Go look up LKY's understanding of global politics.  It was second to none.  He often understood Western politics better than Western politicians and policy makers.  Amos Yee really lacks perspective on all the things he has by living in a Singapore that was developed by LKY, as opposed to a world where LKY never existed.  Amos doesn't understand the difficulty of what LKY accomplished, nor does he understand the complexity of the situation.  His grievances are the complaints from the perspective of living in the richest, safest, technologically advanced societies in the world, built in a short period and starting with many disadvantages.  If you want a direct comparison of what another leader would have created in that situation, look at Malaysia.  Malaysia kicked out Singapore, during those circumstances Singapore and LKY got started.  Ever since, Malaysia has been riddled with incompetent, corrupt, populist policies.    A Singaporean style of government is also partly responsible for the rise of China.  Valid arguments can be made that LKY was among the most influential minds leading to hundreds of millions of Chinese climbing out of poverty.  However, people are having difficulty wrapping their minds around the idea that societies that aren't direct copies of Western democracy can still be good.  There are so many good LKY interviews and lectures online.  He had a first rate brilliant mind, who should be studied much more by political leaders who want to better understand and improve the world.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVcKkPflmT8| 3| 2017-03-29 01:20:56

"By prosecuting Amos Yee for his comments, no matter how outrageous they may have been, Singapore has unfortunately doubled down on a strategy that clearly violates freedom of expression," Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Right Watch's Asia division, said in an email.   Singapore: The world's richest city "For a country that prides itself on efficiency, Singapore should re-examine its approach, because every time the authorities go after him, it just adds to his online audience who are interested to find out the latest thing."  Critics said Yee's imprisonment may further deter freedom of expression in the Asian financial centre.  Singapore's parliament passed a controversial bill last month spelling out what constitutes contempt of court, drawing criticism from rights groups and foreign diplomats.  Amnesty International, the international rights organisation, called on Singapore to "repeal or amend legal provisions that criminalise peaceful dissent and end the intimidation and harassment of bloggers and other critics".  David Kaye, UN special rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression, said: "The lesson that somebody can be thrown in jail for their speech is exactly the wrong kind of message that any government should be sending to anybody, but especially to young people."  &gt; Except for the fact Singapore newspapers report everything every little corruption every criticise govt policies, debate is healthy and open.

I had been supporting Amos Yee from before he first appeared in court here.   &gt; I had already laughed my head off when Yee’s lawyer had said by video link that he was sure Amos would be grateful for my efforts. “No he won’t”, I replied when I stopped laughing. There is no point helping Amos if you are doing it for thanks or gratitude. Do I regret helping him? No, I am also elated but at the same time saddened that Amos had to flee to have a chance at a life and I am aware of how hard life is for an exile or a refugee.| 26| 2017-03-27 09:33:36

singapore| IvanLu| &gt; So what if Calvin Cheng and Jason Neo were not charged? According to this academic article, there are also many other reported cases of people who were in fact charged under the Sedition Act for non-political reasons.  They were punished for insulting religious groups, period.   That's exactly the point isn't it? Why weren't Jason Neo and Calvin Cheng charged. Why was discretion applied in those cases but not Amos Yee? Those guys are adults whereas Amos was a 16 year old kid at the time of offence. Your response that others apart from Amos were charged doesn't explain why.  So if you read the ruling, a total of 8 reasons were cited by the judge in deciding the charges against Amos Yee were against the political content of the video, not the 30s anti-religion rant. One of those charges relate to the obscene image Amos posted of LKY and Thatcher, where the judge note that more explicit images available to the public but did not result in prosecutions.  Taken together, doesn't this imply the authorities were simply looking for reasons to charge him since they don't want to appear to be prosecuting him for political opinions.| 4| 2017-03-26 17:37:22

singapore| dieaready| The term freedom of speech is thrown about so much that nobody even knows how it began or what it is meant for any more. It would help if all those proponents of freedom of speech actually knew the historical context behind it.  Freedom of speech originated from Greece for philosophers to communicate ideas that could be abhorrent but is meant for the purpose of learning and education, plus some of these abhorrent ideas could result in something productive, hence the need to protect their speech.  After that you have the western (more American actually) form of freedom of speech, which is more along the lines of the freedom to criticise the govt without the fear of reprisal from the govt. This means that it applies directly to speech against the govt as it is meant as a tool to fight against possible corruption in the govt without the fear of retaliation.   If whatever is being said is not for the purpose of education or for calling out the govt, then it should not be covered under the term 'freedom of speech'. Besides, freedom of speech only protects you from the govt, and not from everyone else. Sadly, we don't even have that here either.  One good case to use would be Amos Yee. His 'speech' doesn't properly fall under the category of education as it is obvious that his intent was to insult, not educate. On the other hand, I believe there are atheist who regularly speak out against religion but with the obvious intent to educate and not to purposely insult, and they don't get shut down by the govt. Thus Amos deserved what he got.| 1| 2017-03-26 17:00:14

singapore| Schizo-Vreni| Interesting point you are raising. You are right that its not universal. Maybe the discussion is a bit biased right now with amos yee issues, but lets try to look at it with a wider view.  The fact that one cant go to raffles place, and write on a sign that he doesnt agree with the practices of some bank institution, clearly is a severe limit in freedom of speech. You wont argue about this do you?  Its not right to compare the extent of freedom of speech to germany. There are isolated things like naziism that you can express publicly, whereas here, you have general wide limitations to what you express in public.| 4| 2017-03-26 15:10:08

singapore| starrRiver| Huh? This logic makes no sense. How does mere existence of exceptions prove political prosecution?   Example: AGC only selectively enforces laws against littering, but some people still get fined for it. If I follow your logic, does this mean that all those people who got fined are being politically prosecuted?   The AGC can have many reasons for choosing to prosecute some and not others aside from political reasons. They may simply not be aware of the comments, if no one made police reports about them like they did about Amos Yee. They could also have found that the comments were not spread as widely as Amos Yee's video and therefore did not warrant such a serious response. If could also be the case that they routinely send police officers down as a form of warning to people who do make these anti-religious comments, but the commenters usually apologise and de-escalate and we don't hear about it, whereas Amos Yee refused to de-escalate. Now, it is definitely still POSSIBLE that the reason behind their actions were politically slanted, but my point is that you can't jump straight to this conclusion without providing something more than just the presence of exceptions.    Also the other cases are categorically NOT politically slanted, if you bother to read up on them. One of the cases mentioned in the article is Koh Song Huat Benjamin, which involved a blogger making vile comments about muslims. He made no comments about the PAP or government. Neither did Ong Kian Cheong, who got arrested for distributing Chick tracts that denigrated muslims. Again, he wasn't an anti-government figure nor did he criticise the government or the PAP. | -1| 2017-03-26 13:21:13
singapore| penguinQP| Let's just agree to disagree, tbh. I do believe it's inappropriate for Singapore to represent (in a statement targeted at its own citizens, no less) that Amos Yee was welcomed to the US with open arms, as it is doing now.| 1| 2017-03-26 12:50:16
singapore| KaseyRyback| &gt; Amos Yee gets asylum not because the US govt exercised a prerogative, but because the decision was forced on it by one of its judges.  that's as silly as saying Trump became President not because Americans voted for him but because he was forced on the Americans because of their constitutional arrangements.  or as lame as federal politicians - especially when representing their  country internationally - blaming the states or the constitution for not being able to tackle the problems of their country.  put it another way, it's as lame as a business saying your transaction with them is invalid because they forgot to comply with some internal procedures. | 3| 2017-03-26 12:20:16
singapore| penguinQP| &gt; the US federal government is the ultimate representative of the US to other nations - it is irrelevant whether its internal constitutional arrangements oblige it to defer to the federal judiciary, legislature, or state-level bodies on those matters; these are its internal arrangements.  While I agree with you, I do feel that this illusion has been eroded somewhat in light of the Trump administration, and MHA could have done more not to represent this decision, to "take in" Amos Yee, as the federal government's alone.   Nonetheless this is somewhat understandable (for lack of a better word) given the treatment of executive action by the judiciary in Singapore - for better or for worse.| 1| 2017-03-26 12:07:35

But, from what I've personally seen, majority of those around my age whom I know are more or less indifferent towards Amos Yee, while some of the elders whom I know bear some resentment... and less so wish some suffering upon Amos Yee. The only other times I hear of similar sentiment to the latter opinion are either when I'm online, or from taxi drivers who might or might not be 'jokingly' saying such vindictive things. | 1| 2017-03-26 09:17:42

Even in the US, hate speech lands you in trouble, and he's definitely that type of individual since he's already gotten in trouble there.

I mean, it's bad enough to jail the little shit (c'mon, i know a handful of people didn't suffer teenage angst, but the ones that do come up with volatile ideas, it's par for the course), which was ridiculously heavy-handed in its own right... but to have all the edmw-ers turning up saying they hope he gets shot, butt-raped in jail by a black guy (wtf is wrong with these people, is that their literal definition of hell? Having anal sex?!), sent back to SG for more punishment?  I dunno. I'm having a lot of trouble trying to stomach that these are the opinions of people I work and live with.

singapore| starrRiver| My EU example was simply to show that what the public thinks about free speech is irrelevant as a matter of US immigration law. I obviously wasn't saying that EU law applied in the US.  So what if Calvin Cheng and Jason Neo were not charged? [According to this academic article, there are also many other reported cases of people who were in fact charged under the Sedition Act for non-political reasons. ](https://law.nus.edu.sg/sjls/articles/SJLS-Dec11-351.pdf) They were punished for insulting religious groups, period.   The US immigration court's reasoning is premised on this logical leap that just because those two people were not charged, then all prosecutions that were in fact carried out under the Sedition Act are necessarily for political reasons. The examples of people being charged for non-political reasons shows that this is untrue. The fact is the AGC exercises a lot of discretion when deciding who to prosecute under the Sedition Act, and just because they choose to prosecute some and not others doesn't mean that all those prosecutions that they carry out are for political reasons.  I agree that the part about religion was a short segment of the video. That is a valid point in the judgement, although a mere numerical comparison of video length would obviously not in itself conclusive, and the court was probably aware of this. That is probably why he devoted a large part of the judgement to the horrible treatment suffered by Amos Yee and how this is unusual and therefore shows that Amos Yee was being singled out for his political opinion. My original comment was addressing those points in the judgement.  Come on, I did read the ruling. Obviously I'm not sufficiently well-versed in American immigration law to give a full on critique of the judgement. What I wrote was just a shallow rebuttal against some of the points he made. | 3| 2017-03-26 03:31:39

singapore| starrRiver| But American immigration law isn't about what the American or "liberal" POV thinks about whether it is acceptable to criminalise criticising religion. American views on hate speech laws is not even shared by the majority of liberal western democracies. [America is one of the very few western countries that do not criminalise hate speech.](http://www.npr.org/2011/03/03/134239713/France-Isnt-The-Only-Country-To-Prohibit-Hate-Speech) The entire European Union now has to have legislation criminalising [“publicly inciting … hatred directed against a group of persons  defined by reference to … religion”](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:328:0055:0058:en:PDF). Surely not everyone convicted under Germany's hate speech legislation would be able to claim political asylum.  Rather, the US legislation in question specifically requires, according to the [judgement](http://www.grossmanlawllc.com/files/ij-decision_media.pdf), that Amos Yee prove that he was persecuted on account of his "political opinion". All I am saying is that, based solely on what the judge wrote about in that judgement, it is by no means clear that Amos Yee was prosecuted on account of his political opinions about Lee Kuan Yew and the PAP, rather than for his anti-religious remarks. | 4| 2017-03-26 02:34:22
worldnews| MortalBean| &gt;They can if they want to, but they don't really have to. There's absolutely no obligation whatsoever for anyone to put up with other people's shit. It's freedom of speech and freedom of choice, you can choose not to listen to them.  To some extent people should have to though. The example I used was a street preacher. You don't have to stay and listen or even seriously consider what they are saying, but even just passing them on the street is healthy for freedom of speech. There is no point in speaking at all if there will never be an audience. To some extent, you need to force people to listen to each other in order to keep the exchange of ideas going. We can already see echo chambers forming and getting worse as our ability to filter out opposing points of views gets stronger.  &gt;which country are you referring to for getting beaten in the streets?  I'm referring to elsewhere in the comment thread where people are talking about where Amos Yee got beaten due to some shit he said, although the point is independent of any specific example.| 3| 2017-03-26 02:34:22
worldnews| Crypsis2| Inciting unrest and hate speech are better terms, but I guess I used the wrong term in the first place so that's my fault. Once again, he got beaten up when he was still waiting for his asylum appeal while he was in the USA to pass through because he hurt people's feelings again, I'm fairly certain he would've gotten jumped by a bunch of angry catholic thugs if he wasn't in Singapore and made a video like that in a different country, and if he was in a suburban area/third world country he'd probably be dead.  But yeah, you're right as I said there's a problem with freedom of speech in Singapore, I never once said that is normal. I even tried my best in my initial comment to say that I don't think it's normal, just that there's definitely something wrong with Amos Yee and his hate speech.| 0| 2017-03-26 02:06:16
singapore| IvanLu| But of course saying crazy stuff alone does not make them president. If they are nobodys like Amos Yee (in America), nothing's going to happen.

singapore| IvanLu| &gt;But this ignores the fact that Amos Yee initially offered probation by AGC but turned down the offer. He was also only sent to IMH for remand only after he refused counselling and psychiatric evaluation.  From an American or liberal POV, criticism of political figures or religion does not justify any punishment by the state no matter how slight or mitigated. Singapore prosecuted him on these grounds.| 11| 2017-03-26 01:31:05

singapore| starrRiver| No, I don't think the reasoning here is correct. Just because Calvin Cheng and Jason Neo were not prosecuted doesn't mean that the government has never prosecuted other people under the Sedition Act for non-political reasons. [This article](https://law.nus.edu.sg/sjls/articles/SJLS-Dec11-351.pdf) discusses many many reported cases where the Sedition Act was enforced purely for the purpose of countering anti-religious speech instead of for political purposes. The fact is the AGC has always exercised a lot of discretion in enforcing the Sedition Act. Just because some people weren't prosecuted for it doesn't mean that all those who did get prosecuted were being attacked for political reasons.   Also, as I mentioned in another thread, his "unusually long sentence" is also partly because of Yee's refusal to de-escalate. Amos Yee was initially offered probation but he rejected it. He also refused counselling and psychiatric evaluation, which was why he was remanded in IMH. He was offered cheap bail but accused his bailor of molestation. Now, I'm not saying that because he did these things he therefore deserves what he got. All I am saying is that the court's specific line of argument - that because Amos Yee got an unusually long sentence therefore he is is politically prosecuted - is unsound.| 32| 2017-03-26 00:35:40
singapore| starrRiver| Does anyone else think that the court here may have erred by failing to take into account Amos Yee's conduct after the prosecution was commenced?  The court concluded that his conviction was due to political rather than religious reasons because other people who also insulted religious groups were not punished as heavily. The court appeared to swayed by how much Amos suffered in prison and at IMH and how disproportionate this seems compared to the relatively minor crime he committed. But this ignores the fact that Amos Yee [initially offered probation by AGC](https://www.agc.gov.sg/DATA/0/Docs/NewsFiles/15.7.6_Amos%20Yee%20Written%20Skeletal%20Subs%20\(with%20Annexes\).pdf) but turned down the offer. He was also only sent to IMH for remand only after he refused counselling and psychiatric evaluation. In addition, he was offered bail but fucked it up by being making false molestation accusations about his bailor as everyone already knows.  If the government had wanted to punish him severely for political reasons, why would the AGC offer probation and counselling and let him off easy at first? Were they supposed to be hoping that he would refuse? Why would they offer him cheap bail? How could they have known that he would somehow fuck up his bail?  To be fair, it is possible that the police was partly influenced by the desire to quell public anger towards Amos when they first decided to pay him a visit and give him a warning, but the escalation to a full blown conviction and sentencing is also partly because Amos had forced the hands of the government. It is only because Amos (either because of stupidity or bravery depending on how you see him) refused all attempts at a low-profile low-stake resolution of this issue, and because there was no way for the government to really de-escalate without doing violence to the rule of law, that the full force of the law was brought upon him.| 7| 2017-03-26 00:08:26

The US, said the MHA, adopts a different standard from Singapore towards hate speech. "It allows some hate speech under the rubric of freedom of speech. The US for example, in the name of freedom of speech, allows the burning of the Quran." &gt;  &gt; Singapore, said the ministry, takes a very different approach. &gt;  &gt; ## [[LINK: amos.jpg]](http://www.straitstimes.com/files/amosjpg) &gt;  &gt; [[Amos Yee arriving at the State Courts, on Aug 17, 2016. ]](http://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2017/03/25/amos.jpg?itok=KIST5JSx) &gt;  &gt; Related Story &gt;  &gt; #### [[LINK: US judge grants Amos Yee's asylum request]](http://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/us-judge-grants-amos-yees-asylum-request) &gt;  &gt; "Anyone who engages in hate speech or attempts to burn the Quran, Bible, or any religious text in Singapore, will be arrested and charged." &gt;  &gt; The ministry said: "There are many more such people, around the world, who deliberately engage in hate speech, and who may be prosecuted. &gt;  &gt; "Some of them, will no doubt take note of the US approach, and consider applying for asylum in the US." &gt;  &gt; US immigration Judge Samuel Cole has granted Yee asylum after he concluded that the Singapore Government "persecuted Yee on account of his political opinion". &gt;  &gt; This comes after the US Department of Homeland Security opposed Yee's asylum application, on the basis that Yee had been legitimately prosecuted. &gt;  &gt; In its statement, MHA detailed the various charges in 2015 and 2016 against Yee, who - it said - was represented by counsel. &gt;  &gt; In 2015, he was charged and convicted for engaging in hate speech against Christians. &gt;  &gt; He was also convicted on another charge for publishing an obscene image. He was sentenced to a total of four weeks imprisonment for these charges. &gt;  &gt; In 2016, Yee was charged again for hate speech, this time against Muslims and Christians. &gt;  &gt; He pleaded guilty to the charges, and was sentenced to six weeks imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.   === _^This ^bot ^was ^created ^by ^/u/LFlare, ^being ^too ^poor ^to ^afford ^ST ^subscription ^fees._  _^[Feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=LFlare&amp;subject=[RedditNewsPostBot%20-%20https://redd.it/61f81g]%20)_ _^[GitHub](https://github.com/LFlare/redditnewspostbot)_| 11| 2017-03-25 20:07:35

singapore| RedditNewsPostBot| **Extracted Article:**  &gt; By [[LINK: Timothy Mclaughlin]](http://www.reuters.com/journalists/timothy-mclaughlin) &gt;  &gt;  | CHICAGO &gt;  &gt; CHICAGO A U.S. immigration judge in Chicago on Friday granted asylum to a Singaporean blogger, saying he was persecuted for his political opinions in the Southeast Asian city-state. &gt;  &gt; Amos Yee, 18, who had been jailed twice in Singapore, qualifies as a political refugee, according to a 13-page opinion by the U.S. immigration judge. &gt;  &gt; Yee is immediately eligible for release after having been held in U.S. immigration detention since Dec. 16, 2016, according to his attorney, Sandra Grossman, who is based in Bethesda, Maryland. &gt;  &gt; The Singapore Embassy in Washington could not be reached for comment after business hours on Friday evening. &gt;  &gt; Judge Samuel Cole ruled Yee's prosecution, detention and maltreatment at the hands of the Singapore authorities "constitute(s) persecution on account of Yee's political opinions," and called him a "young political dissident. &gt;  &gt; "The evidence presented at the hearing demonstrates Singapore's prosecution of Yee was a pretext to silence his political opinions critical of the Singapore government," Cole wrote. &gt;  &gt; The U.S. Department of Homeland Security had opposed Yee's asylum application, claiming the Singapore government legitimately prosecuted Yee. &gt;  &gt; Grossman said the judge's decision supported the right of individuals to criticize their government. &gt;  &gt; "The right to free speech is sacred, even when such speech is considered offensive," she said in an email. "The decision timely underscores the vital need for an independent judiciary in a functioning democracy." &gt;  &gt; Yee had been held by U.S. authorities since arriving at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, seeking political asylum. He was initially detained in Illinois, but is now being held at the Dodge County Detention Facility in Juneau, Wisconsin, Grossman said. &gt;  &gt; Yee has been jailed twice in Singapore for online comments. His trials, which have been closely watched by rights groups and the United Nations, have fueled the debate in Singapore over censorship, the limits of free speech and political correctness. &gt;  &gt; In September of last year, Yee pleaded guilty to six charges of deliberately posting comments on the internet - in videos, blog posts and a picture - that were critical of Christianity and Islam. He was sentenced to six weeks in jail. &gt;  &gt; In 2015, Yee was convicted on charges of harassment and insulting a religious group over comments he made about former premier Lee Kuan Yew and Christians soon after Lee's death. His sentence at the time amounted to four weeks in jail. &gt;  &gt; (Reporting by Timothy Mclaughlin in Chicago, writing by Ben Klayman in Detroit; editing by Diane Craft)   === _^This ^bot ^was ^created ^by ^/u/LFlare, ^being ^too ^poor ^to ^afford ^ST ^subscription ^fees._  _^[Feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=LFlare&amp;subject=[RedditNewsPostBot%20-%20https://redd.it/61ebka]%20)_ _^[GitHub](https://github.com/LFlare/redditnewspostbot)_| 2| 2017-03-25 14:39:24

singapore| popsilolicle| So the feelings that were invoked in you were caused by the government's and media's reaction to the piece and the fact that it was shut down. Not the piece itself, which as I discussed, is of little artistic value. Which is exactly what I'm getting at.  Take for example, the 13 yo girl who became famous for her rude and explicit interview on Dr. Phil. Her "work" has made her famous, sparked controversy, and become and internationally recognizable meme. Would you deem her "work" as "art"? It has all the qualities that artists strive to achieve when they produce material. If you had the slightest inkling of critical thinking, you would deem her performance as an embarrassment and a poor reflection of her environment and upbringing. The fact that this girl has people who praise her and encourage her to continue with this type of behavior is disturbing. See also, Amos Yee and his downward spiral.  Now in that same vein (but of course to a lesser extent), the gold stairs, was not a high standard of content, why should people continue to encourage the girl when it's not quality work? If people genuinely respected her as an artist, they would say, hey your work is uninspired, work harder and come back with something truly moving. Not, oh gahmen shut down expression, wah this girl so brave and artistic. Really? That's not going to help her, in fact it's responses like this that drive people to continue with their behaviors and circle jerk around the rhetoric of "Sillypore gahmen bad". Is that really the best that Singaporeans can produce??  If she had done it as a statement, to provoke the sentiment that our government is too harsh with individual expression, then yes I can see the artistic value in that. But those sentiments were evoked by the government's actions to remove the piece. It was not an inherent quality in the work that evoked your emotional response and neither was it her intent. It was the fact that the government shut it down.   Criticism is good, any artist worth their salt has gone through intense criticism, how else would they improve. It's not wrong to dismiss something for what it is, if you continue to support mediocrity then how will the scene ever progress?  | 1| 2017-03-18 22:29:26

todayilearned| lyzergnature| Amos Yee, the teenage Singaporean blogger jailed twice for posts denigrating religion and the country’s late founding leader Lee Kuan Yew, has been detained in the United States while trying to seek political asylum.  “US authorities should recognise that Singapore has engaged in a sustained pattern of harassment and abuse of Amos because of his political views, especially his regular denunciations of the country’s leader and violations of the ruling [People’s Action Party’s] restrictions on public expression,” Robertson said.  Yee was sentenced to a six-week jail term in September after pleading guilty to six charges of deliberately making social media posts that denigrated Christianity and Islam.| 3| 2017-03-06 13:21:52
singapore| _hazy_future_| No. It means that whoever attacks other religions, even based on religious faith, will not be tolerated.  This shows that Singapore is not all about protecting religions (a notion that appeared after the Amos yee debacle) , but harmony.   | 3| 2017-03-04 19:10:58
KotakuInAction| MagosBiologis| Yup, insult any religion (or atheists) and you'll be warned. The country will suffer if there is religious/ethnic strife again, so stirring up religious/ethnic divisions is illegal. Various victims of this law include Islamist extremists, American-style evangelicals who distributed Chick tracts, and Amos Yee.  Generally it's a warning first though. Amos was jailed after violating bail conditions, contempt of court, and on top of that refusing probation and asking the court for jail instead.  Last I heard he's in solitary confinement in *America* for insulting Muslims while in a detention centre, seeking asylum from "teh evil unfree authoritarian dystopia of Singapore which oppresses my right to insult religion". Good for him, Uncle Sam can take over handling him now. As of now he's been detained in America for longer than his jail term in Singapore, and with anti-refugee Trump at the helm I think he's going to be there for a long time.  http://mothership.sg/2017/02/amos-yees-mother-confirms-amos-yee-in-solitary-confinement-in-us-for-2-weeks/| 0| 2017-03-02 22:22:11
singapore| AmazingRW| &gt;And I think that his ban from commenting or distributing any content online as part of the bail conditions was unfair to him.  1. The investigations and court proceedings are not there to approve or disapprove the accused's views.  2. The bail conditions which specifically disallow an individual from uploading additional video content is entirely unrelated to the silencing of the person. Amos Yee had all the rights to speak to the media or to communicate his conditions through any other channels. This **is exactly how he accused his surety of being a molester**. 3. The bail conditions are usually set in order to prevent the accused from aggravating his offences. For example, a person who has been accused of assaulting somebody has to promise to stay away from the victim. A person who has been accused of committing a gun crime might have his weapons temporarily confiscated (in America) etc. 4. The judiciary is designed to be insulated from societal pressure. This ensures that the courts would hand down fair judgements in accordance to the law rather than relying on the mood of the society. To encourage a "public furore" in order to influence the courts' decisions would be counterproductive.   This is not an issue of public furore or power difference. The legal system is not as shallow as some might think it is. Shouting louder does not mean that one is right, we are not living in the medieval age.  | 6| 2017-03-02 19:05:44

singapore| MagosBiologis| I'm no shrink but I'd say it's probably more of histrionic personality disorder than sociopathy. Amos Yee is bloody terrible at deception, and his behaviour is more like self-sabotaging showboating than any sort of strategic Machiavellianism.| 5| 2017-03-02 00:24:24

singapore| PhantomWolf83| I wonder if Amos Yee is actually a sociopath or on the way to becoming one?

singapore| Tusjecht| &gt; “This is a free speech issue and everyone will be on my side”.  I feel more sad for Amos than anything else, because this is less about an insensitive teenager with racist views, and more of a person who has yet to understand that the ideals of free speech do not include the freedom from its consequences. Amos Yee is going to have his harshest lesson in the Land of the Brave and Home of the Free that the world does not love him.  Edit: Also OP. this article is nearly a week old. Some follow-up article would be better than this| 203| 2017-03-01 10:36:46

KotakuInAction| HariMichaelson| What you mean rule 1? Don't be a dickwolf? Nothing vague there.  I think you're misunderstanding the point of this post, and the way KIA works; you can say you're fucking D. B. Cooper and have zero evidence to prove it, but you probably won't be banned, at least not if you post such a thing as a comment instead of an actual post. There is no such thing as a "wrong opinion" on this subreddit.  For example, if I were to, as Amos Yee once did, make a serious, concerted effort to argue for the legalization of the production and distribution of child pornography, I doubt I would be banned, so long as I didn't say something like, "I should be allowed to watch little kids fuck, and anyone who disagrees with me is a stupid, drooling cunt." Have fun with that, r/nocontext.  I'd probably be downvoted well past the 9th circle of hell, but I doubt I'd be banned.| 3| 2017-02-27 20:37:08

singapore| WhatIsPaint| There is a certain amount of freedom of speech. It has been improving over the years. People don't really censor themselves that much online. A lot of people on my Facebook constantly go on angry anti government rants with no repercussions. Even on forums, people tend to mock the government without issue.   I think, they tend to leave you alone until you gain some traction or look like you could possibly influence things. I have no idea.  But I think what most non Singaporeans don't realise is that when someone gets prosecuted for saying something. It isn't always because of the big scary government controlling things.  I mean, they're there. They do actually go overboard with going after opinionated people.  But what's sadder to me is that there's a decent amount of regular people who do believe in silencing others. Just by looking at the comments against Amos yee on my Facebook was saddening. Amos yee was an annoying cunt, but that's it. That's all he is. He deserves to be ignored and left alone. But people won't shut up about him. A lot of them think he deserves punishment and jail time. I even know people I'm real life who think that way. It isn't just the usual online vitriol.  And there was the Little India riots where the foreign workers, well, rioted. And so many people started saying pretty racist things and wanted there to be a larger police presence in that area and were all for an alcohol ban for them. And the alcohol curfew happened in that area, which then was applied throughout the whole nation. And that's when people said started bitching about how strict the government is. Because now it suddenly affects them.   There was also the news about the "gay" penguin kids book available in the public library. If it was available in the library, it would mean that it got through the whole system and the government was okay with it being there. But a vocal minority kicked up a fuss about it and now it's banned. But even then, I know people who wanted also that book gone.  And half the time, I'm more worried about accidentally doing something stupid and pissing off someone who would take a video and put it up online than I am about the government.  The government isn't great. They are pretty prone to censoring things and really don't like being mocked. They're trying to be better but currently it feels like society is enabling them.   The system kind of feels like a recovering addict with society constantly going, "Are you sure you don't want to ban this? Are you sureeeee? You know you want to. Just a little bit won't hurt."   How are we supposed to progress when half the time it feels like people want freedom of speech, but only for themselves and people who agree with them.          | 6| 2017-02-11 00:47:16
singapore| MisoMesoMilo| Yes. In the sense you need to be responsible for you say and ready to defend it. I hope we see less people like Roy ngerng and Amos Yee. There's no need to be inflammatory for your point to be carried across. | 0| 2017-02-10 17:40:19
singapore| not_a_reddiporean| Freedom of speech for us is to be responsible with our words. If you don't go overboard, you'll be fine.   Judging from local facebook content's comments, I believe most people do not self-censor or avoid much topic. I usually don't self-censor but I avoid discussing political/controversial issues online as much as I can because I believe it can open many cans of worms. If you want some entertainment, you can head over to facebook and search for some Singaporean (political)pages. Head over to the comments section and enjoy the show.   Amos Yee and Roy Ngerng are just retards who were NOT responsible with their words. | 3| 2017-02-10 09:39:02
singapore| Ceredan| The common misconception about our freedom of speech is that our government heavily regulates what the citizens say. This is far from the case, and we rarely avoid discussing any topics, even if they are controversial.  The reason why people like Amos Yee are persecuted in Singapore is the same reason why youtubers are getting thrown off planes for speaking in Arabic. A small minority of very vocal people feel like their safe-zone is being violated or their feelings are hurt, and they want to get rid of this feeling. Because of this, the very vocal people make a ton of noise, and the ones who didn't care in the first place get dragged into it.   Honestly, Amos would have been just another typical teenager who is vocal about his political views. He just made a stupid(or smart, who knows) move and drew a huge amount of attention to himself.| 10| 2017-02-10 01:10:40

singapore| Isares| Amos Yee was manipulated by the religious leaders of Singapore to become increasingly ridiculous in his actions, so as to villify the act of speaking out against religion ie. "trying to become the next Amos Yee ah" and to gather sympathy to aid in forming/naturalize their internet brigade should there ever be any calls for restrictions to be imposed on the religious community.   Lee Kuan Yew's body was cremated so that he can't crawl out of his grave to tell the govt to shut the fuck up and sit the fuck down (like he promised) whenever something stupid was done. | 27| 2017-02-02 07:24:19

Christianity| WackyModder84| Ah, so you _do_ acknowledge that Taqiyya exists then! Alrighty. =)  But here's the deal. What you just said is what I _originally_ thought what Taqiyya was. I originally thought Taqiyya was primarily used whenever Shia Muslims felt that their life was in danger, and Sunni's would also, again, only practice it if they felt threatened or forced as well. That was my _original_ assessment on Taqiyya as a whole.  As shown in _this_ verse here:  Quran 16:106  &gt; _"Whoever disbelieves in Allah after his belief... except for one who is forced [to renounce his religion] while his heart is secure in faith. But those who [willingly] open their breasts to disbelief, upon them is wrath from Allah , and for them is a great punishment;"_  _That_ was what I originally thought about Taqiyya at first, after seeing that verse. But the verse that I posted _before_, Quran 3:28, completely negates this. Because as it does say there, Muslims can lie to gain allies and friends in order to seem like a team player rather than an adversary.  In fact, as another example: **Adam Saleh**, a Muslim YouTube Star w/ over 1.6 Million Subscribers, was caught _red-handed_ committing both Taqiyya _and_ Kitman on multiple occasions. The latest big one he had was when he lied to everyone's faces about what happened with Delta Airlines. And before that was during the Amos Yee incident where he was caught practicing Kitman by Misquoting the Quran entirely.  Like I said, I have absolutely nothing against you whatsoever if that's what I might be coming off as. But this is the conclusive evidence I've found upon studying the Quran w/ Taqiyya so far. Sorry if I may have unintentionally came off as a dick, but I'm merely just saying that which is logical and conclusive here. =\| 2| 2017-01-29 15:13:51
singapore| WANG_BA_DAN| #"Potentially"??  Singapore is practically **defined** by its OB markers. What is Singapore? Singapore is a set of things you cannot do, cannot say, cannot think, cannot believe. You don't question CPF. You don't question HDB. You don't question race on your IC. You don't question minister salaries. The list goes on and on and on.  Whenever any of these things are brought up, they're spoken about in exceedingly gentle and superficial terms. Singapore has **already** suffered from this **tremendously**; we don't realize it because the smart people who have suffered have either gone (migrated) or have been suppressed to the point of apathy and disengagement. **We live in the aftermath of political cauterization.**  I mean, just take this black guy right here, and use his exact words in the SG context. Know your history. **Singapore's history is one of suppression and coercion.** People being detained without trial. Who wants to fuck with the PAP government? You'd have to be either really ignorant or really naive, or both.   SG has suffered from the "problem of political correctness" for half a century. You just don't see it because apart from a few renegades (or morons, or both) like CSJ, JBJ, Roy Ngerng, Amos Yee – everybody else has long learned to shut up and follow suit, or only speak their minds in private. And those exceptions prove the rule. We might as well drag them out into the streets and shoot them. Roy will be paying PM Lee until **2033**. Jesus F Christ.  Where is the real, true opposition? Where is the smart opposition? They're like Trump supporters – hiding in plain sight. They refuse to vote for our current opposition because the current opposition is incompetent. Any competent opposition likely gets coopted into the PAP or is otherwise neutralized as a threat.  "Potentially". Smh. Just goes to show what a great whitewashing job the PAP has done.

singapore| AmazingRW| The government took action because dozens of people filed complaints with the police. I doubt that it would make good sense to punish a teenage from the public relations standpoint, so, there might actually be a sense of reluctance to blow up the matter.  The freedom of speech should never be an all or nothing subject, it should be tailored to each and every society to varying degrees, and this includes the punishment. You are right to mention that the penalties should correspond to the seriousness of the offenses.  Amos Yee's punishment is originally meant to be light, however, he himself aggravated the situation, which resulted in the final verdict of a 4-week-jail-term. He broke bail conditions multiple times, defied court order, and refused to show up for probation sessions. The court ultimately granted him the jail term according to his own request. Amos Yee chose jail over probation.   Why did he choose jail? Because he knew that he has been in remand, and that the jail term could be backdated. Why was he in remand? Because his parents refused to bail him out. A stranger bailed him out, and immediately following that, he turned around and accused the man of molestation (which has caused a great deal of pain for the man, no doubt). He then broke the bail conditions again. That is why he was put under remand. His parents again refused to bail him out.  Should Amos Yee's parents have bailed him out, should he not have broken the bail conditions, then he would never have had any need to backdate his jail term. He could have been let off with probation. These are the facts that should be taken into account when assessing the reasonableness of the penalties.  Such cases are not uncommon. Bloggers have previously been penalised for similar acts, but those cases mostly ended up with the content being taken down and the offending individuals being fined small sums of money. So, it is not exactly right to claim that the government's actions are disproportionate to the offenses in cases where the accused deliberately worsened his own position.| 19| 2017-01-23 00:19:44

Many Singaporeans are already pro-Forced conscription and anti-LGBT marriage/adoption. From Amos Yee's case, we can also see that many are for the legal restriction of hate speech.   So even if someone tells you that they are pro-civil liberties, you should probe a little further to see where they truly stand.

In the video Yee compared Lee to Jesus, and cast both in an unfavorable light. Yee also uploaded to his blog an image depicting Lee Kuan Yew and Margaret Thatcher engaged in anal sex.

Too bad, some people just got pissed off and that happened. Last I heard, was seeking asylum in the US or something.

worldnews| creamcup| Look at the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms. That's a "right" that many countries have supposedly taken away.   I know that there is an ideal when it comes to free speech that is especially harboured in Western nations, but the sentiment here (and in a lot of Eastern nations) is that it does *more harm than good* when people spew vitriol. Many people I know who are not from Singapore think that the US government needs to clamp down on people who are toxic to society such as the WBC.   Hate speech is so, so wrong on so many levels, and that is essentially what Amos Yee was doing. | 11| 2016-12-25 05:19:42

worldnews| creamcup| But you see, in Singapore, the right to "freedom of speech" is not as the same as that in the US.   First of all, Amos Yee isn't being persecuted because he insulted the ex PM. People can and do express dissent with regards to the government on public platforms like social media. (It was just his really irreverent, offhand and attention-seeking manner which shocked people - Singaporeans tend to be timid by nature). He is being persecuted because he has offended pretty much every ethnoreligious group in Singapore. He hasn't simply angered people in the Singaporean government, he has angered the entire population. And this is what Singaporean laws disallow.   Now let me explain why Singapore laws disallow speech that is targeted to and offends other ethnic groups.   Singapore is a small country with no natural resources, with different ethnic groups (the majority of which). These ethnic groups are naturally at odds with one another and due to the reasons I have described above, some kind of government oppression is necessary to prevent complete chaos. This is especially important because Singapores only resource is really the human resource. It's not perfect, but I think it's really a lot better than to deal with huge amounts of antagonistic behaviour from the opposing ethnic groups (look at Malaysia, so many complications there from pretty much the same three groups, Chinese Indians Malays, with the difference being that Malays are the majority in Malaysia as opposed to the Chinese in Singapore).   I don't think the oppression is completely fair, but most Singaporeans can understand the rationale behind it. TBH everyone here hates him and would be glad to have him gone permanently. | 27| 2016-12-25 04:03:21

singapore| AmazingRW| One of those attacks was totally unrelated to his speeches. He got into a scuffle with a delinquent in a shopping mall due to petty antics.  I do not think that Amos Yee would have gotten the jail term of 4 weeks had he not worsened the situation by repeatedly breaking bail terms, refusing and not showing up for probation, and breaking agreements to halt the upload of content while the case was pending (he went against court orders). He also accused his bailer of molesting him...as a joke.  Is that what one would describe merely as a "whining kid"? When we consider his sentence, we should also take into account the series of events that led to it. The sentence that he received was almost definitely heavier than what he would have gotten originally, due to his defiant behaviours. He was initially sentenced to probation, he rejected it and asked for a jail term **voluntarily**. | 0| 2016-12-24 17:12:09

singapore| Patzer1234| &gt;When words spoken have the potential to threaten peace on a societal and national level, I believe some form of consequences is necessary.  A fair point, but notice how easy this principle can be abused to maintain a governments grip on power? I dare say that everything, when framed in certain contexts, can be passed off reasonably as having "the potential to threaten peace".  This is especially so for Singapore, where our mainstream media outlets are heavily influenced by the government. It is evident that our current state of society and political structure is not ideal. I would accept if you believe that Singapore's system is a satisfactory solution to the order-oppression problem, but it seems to that our current state of affairs is unacceptable and that it needs progress. Amos Yee, however obnoxious he is, does bring some change to the table, and without unlovable pricks like him, Singapore will forever be an oppressive country. | 4| 2016-12-24 10:57:05
singapore| doc-tom| &gt; Why can't all the Syrians and Rohingya and whichever people persecuted by their own governments do the same?  Because they can't travel to the US. The airlines will stop you from boarding the plane if you don't have a legit visa. They don't have to process your asylum application if you are not on US soil. This is why countries like Australia try to prevent asylum seekers from reaching their borders. Amos Yee had a Singapore passport which allowed him to enter the US legally. He only applied for asylum after he **entered** the country.| 16| 2016-12-24 00:37:37
singapore| doc-tom| Sigh...  Most commenters here don't understand how refugees and asylum seekers are treated in the US. If Amos Yee is determined to be a legitimate refugee by ~~the US state department~~ an immigration judge, he can apply for permanent residency after one year and get a green card. With this green card, he can then enroll in a community college or a school for further education at local rates to continue his education. He will in fact have more opportunities than most people on this subreddit, given the size of the US.   I am willing to bet that in two years' time, he will be showing off his green card on his Youtube channel.

singapore| paper_boxes| SINGAPORE - Teenage blogger Amos Yee has been detained in the United States over immigration-related matters.  According to the United States' Immigration and Customs Enforcement website, an "Amos Pang Sang Yee" from Singapore is currently detained at the McHenry County Jail, an hour's drive from Chicago.  There were no other details about the detention on the website, but the South China Morning Post reported on Friday (Dec 23) that the 18-year-old was detained after he landed at Chicago's O'Hare Airport on Dec 16.   The paper quoted US-based Singaporean activist Melissa Chen as saying he had entered the US on a tourist visa, but was detained following a secondary screening in which he told immigration officers he was seeking asylum.  According to the US Department of Homeland Security, asylum may be granted to those who are unable or unwilling to return to their home country.  This must be due to persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution because of the asylum seeker's race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.  When The Straits Times contacted his mother Mary Toh on Friday, she declined to comment on whether she had spoken to her son, or what she plans to do.  Mr Yee has served two prison terms for wounding religious feelings.  In September 2016, he was jailed six weeks and fined $2,000 for eight charges - two for failing to turn up at a police station and six for intending to wound the feelings of Muslims and/or Christians.  In July 2015, he served a four-week sentence for making remarks that were derogatory and offensive to Christians in an online video.| 3| 2016-12-23 20:30:00

singapore| NO_LAH_WHERE_GOT| The address part is actually a simple statement of fact. As in, literally there were 3 HDB dwelling students in a class of 20 or more kids.  Some points:  1. Think about the kids who go to RI even before they get there. 18% of Singaporeans live in private housing, and [they account for almost 40% of the top PSLE scorers and more than 40% of IP school enrolment](http://www.salary.sg/2009/hdb-kids-dont-perform-as-well-in-psle/). 2. Consider private school fees. RI and RGS have school fees of $300/month. For context, Victoria School, Cedar Girls are about $25-$28/mo. This allows them to afford more resources. They can pay more for teachers with degrees (I have a friend who's super passionate about literature, studied Lit at UCL, taught RI boys for a few years). In contrast, as someone else pointed out, in other schools teachers have to worry disproportionately more about kids from problem families, fighting, etc. They barely get to teach. 3. They have smaller classroom sizes (at least for the GEP classes, afaik). This allows teachers to devote more time and energy per student. And these students are already well-read and well-prepared before they step into the gate. Why? Well, how many kids of cai png sellers do you see reading philosophy for fun at age 13? There will be some – and more often than not I think they end up like Amos Yee (outcast misfit amongst peer groups) rather than in RI.  The way to think about the relationship of peer group and education isn't 'separate' or 'combined', but rather 'conditional'. That is, RI's 'unique education' is CONDITIONAL on the fact that they take in such high-functioning, well-adjusted kids – who are predominantly from high-functioning, well-adjusted families – who disproportionately tend to be wealthy. The 'education bit' DEPENDS on having a great set of kids to work with, and the resources to pay for great teachers, facilities and so on.  As a thought experiment – reduce RI's budget to the same as regular schools (which will drive away talented teachers). Swap out the cohort with neighbourhood school kids. How do you see that playing out?  Really, just examine the kids going into RI before they even get there. They are already different from the rest of the population. This gets compounded because they get a lot of attention, a lot of positive feedback and reinforcement. For 90++% of them, wealth (I don't just mean money) and strong support networks are always a part of the equation.   **EDIT:** Thinking on it harder, I realize the whole thing is easier to parse if we flip the question. Why *don't* neighbourhood school students perform as well as RI students?| 7| 2016-12-22 13:09:42

The_Donald| DopeWithAScope| Dude, the guy is Adam Saleh, he runs a youtube prank channel and he's constantly faking bullshit 'islamophobia social experiments'. He came clean a short while ago about faking another instance and he's the same dude who had his followers brigade Amos Yee for making a video about islam. Guy is a complete sociopath fucking lying shill for islam. I wont link to his shit because I don't want to give him the views.  Fuck. I didn't think the scummy cunt could sink any lower smh.| 636| 2016-12-22 03:38:53
singapore| tjhan| Can't say for the current and past few batches since the IP began, but judging from career trajectory of Rafflesians from 10 years ago and anecdotal observations...  1. Larger proportion of affluence. Most live in landed or condos. The HDB dwellers are also the middle class type. There's the rare low income type, maybe 1 out of 100. These tend to be very very motivated and excel incredibly.   2. Larger proportion of Christians and Catholics, attending "old school" churches. For comparison, in NUS, there were barely any Christians not from the mega churches. But in Raffles, there wasn't a single person from a megachurch. The Indian representation was quite high in Raffles but there were few Malays. Yet still way more than Chinese High obviously.  3. The average Rafflesian has accepted his fate as a mediocre one who will never reach the heights of some of his more illustrious peers. Yet the accepted level of mediocrity is still way higher than what most other people achieve. Example would be "I'm so mediocre, I'm only a doctor or lawyer while people my year are already rated as top 40 lawyers in Singapore or founded a million dollar startup at 25." I suppose most people on the outside would never have seen how brilliant some of the top minds from each year are, so they don't fathom how far from the top they are. The people who tended to complain about Raffles being stressful were those not from RI but joined in RJC, after being top of their respective cohorts in sec sch and treated like a god previously.  4. Different types of hobbies and interests for sure. Someone like Amos Yee would actually have fit in quite well at Raffles. There were plenty of nutcases and demagogues (though with the intelligence to back it up somewhat). A lot of students there have deep interest in public policy or their area of intended career. E.g. there were plenty of discussions re: government that were more well thought out at the age of 15 than what most adults in Singapore would ever have at the end of their careers. That said, Counterstrike and other games and sports were also played heavily so that part is the same as others.  5. Finally for career. Mid to high flying civil servants, Bankers, doctors, lawyers, software engineers would be considered the norm. There were a lot of altruistic Rafflesians who founded their own NGOS, or became teachers. Finally, small numbers of entrepreneurs (see Ninja Van, Grain etc). This is a combination of many factors, detractors would feel that having the Raffles brand confers advantages in career (though this appears to be the case only in public sector).   Overall, I would say the main difference is the level of exposure, from peers, teachers and especially parents. I compare my friend who teaches lit in RGS versus another friend teaching in a neighbourhood school at the same level, the former has students who weep over poetry and are eager to learn more outside the classroom, the latter has to spend most of her time trying to impart basic grammar and vocab to disinterested kids. I'm sure the disinterested kids would be more interested in lit if they could be taught to interpret popular culture like Game of Thrones or Marvel Movies, but how can that be done when half the class can barely even write well?  At least before the IP, the education syllabus in RI was not all that different from another school. Now I'm sure its different. Again from anecdotal accounts, it seems that there is a a marked change in the school population. Did you know that before IP, only about 50 percent of RI people go onto RJ? The 50 percent who didn't go either couldn't make it thru their grades, or decided to go to HCJC or elsewhere nearer to their homes. The 50 percent that replaced them were basically the go-getters and elites from other schools like MGS, SCGS etc. So it appears that with IP making everyone go through the streamlined approach, average scores are down. Only the truly elite appear to benefit from IP fully. There's a lot more people coasting by than before. At least that's what I hear from people who went through IP.  Edit: I thought of one more. In my time at NUS, I constantly heard the phrase "this one not in syllabus, learn for what". That was almost never the case in RI, no one disdained learning. Which is quite ironic considering university is supposed to be for self-learning and broadening minds. To me this was the single biggest difference between my RI friends and NUS friends. | 96| 2016-12-21 14:18:27
singapore| salientlife93| ....Amos Yee?| 18| 2016-12-19 19:12:01
singapore| kijjklmkkkjkk| Ok, well... Lesson learnt, if you want to chat with a girl and simultaneously tweet that you want to fuck her, make sure she doesn’t notice (or not make it so obvious, fuck). Yeah... That girl I masturbated to from the anime convention, that was Rochelle. I do have a crush on her; she’s cute, an atheist and does english lit, so that’s my kinda gal. Yeah, I am a celebrity and all, and there's like this intimidating aura, but really I’m also still a horny, desperate teen XD I have absolutely no idea about this ‘harassment’ thing she’s claiming I did to her, I'm guessing she might have been annoyed when I recommended she dropped out of school (I recommend that to everyone else too), asked why she was asexual and that she should be open to the idea of sex if the right opportunity ever comes (yeah, I was totally trying to get under her pants there, she's really fucking hot). But really, most of the convo was talking about other things like: our family, interests, school, favourite animes, hobbies, memes and her supposed multi-layered ironic comedy she thought she had. In fact, she was the person, not me, who constantly created new topics for us to talk about and we chatted for a total of about 5 hours over the course of 2 days, so if she was really in pain and 'harassed', I think she would have blocked me much sooner. And across those 2 days of chatting, I took a break from the conversation whenever I wanted to do something else without telling her, and every time I came back to check my phone, there was always a new message from her, and almost everything I said to her, she replied immediately (it was like the whole day she was on Facebook). So really, I’m the one who wanted to fuck her, but she seemed to be more into it than me, so don’t blame me that I thought she could be willing to reciprocate by sucking my dick. The entire conversation I had with her, honestly, I don’t think there was anything really desperate or ‘PLEASE ROCHELLE, JUST STOP TALKING AND FUCK ME IN THE ASS’ that I said. The only things that I said that might be remotely creepy was something along the lines of: ‘wow we have the same interests, I feel so connected to you right now,’ or ‘how the hell do you watch harem anime and not get horny. Do you have repressed sexual rage? You want to make out or something?, but that’s really more of playful teasing than harassment or desperate teen wanting to fuck you right? From what I said to her personally, she might have sensed I had a crush on her, but I don’t think I ever said anything enough for her to be creeped out. Honestly I think that we hit if off wonderfully, until she found out that I was referring to her in my tweets. And honestly, those tweets would be completely fine if rochelle didn’t notice it, but since she did, I’m so sorry I creeped you out rochelle XD And never in that conversation was she like: ‘please stop talking to me, otherwise I’m gonna block you’, unless she was in pain and was lying about being enthusiastic to talk to me, (which it could happen, I’m not sure if it did, it’s facebook messenger), she really seemed to be enjoying the chat, and I enjoyed it too :D Believe me it’s not because I’m just very oblivious, if you were in my position I guarantee you wouldn’t get that too. It was kind of a very sudden surprise when she blocked me, we were in the middle of talking about marching in national day, then I noticed she blocked me on Twitter; I asked her why (because I didn’t think she would notice at that time, silly me); then she gave me a gif that said ‘SMACKDOWN’; and then blocked me on Facebook. And what is this thing that I shit talked about her friends? I literally just passed a comment on ONE of her friends (not gonna mention the name, I’m assuming it could probably reduce the embarrassment), ‘She has that I'm physically unattractive but I know alot and have a huge heart kind of face’, then Rochelle disagreed and said no I find her ‘cute’ and I love her eyes’ so then I replied: yeah ‘personality could make up for genetics’ and that I’d probably feel the same way about her too if I knew her long enough. I don’t think this is considered ‘shit-talking’ (I would take screenshots of the PM, but I'm not a cunt). And also, never did I say that she was asexual just because someone hurt her, when she revealed that to me, I literally just asked’ wait, are you asexual because of some traumatic experience that happened to you or something?’. And then she said ‘no’ and I believed her. I never thought or insisted she was asexual because of a traumatic experience. Though admittedly, maybe I naively thought that I could (it could happen, right?) be the one who made her become sexual, introduce her to the pleasures of a jumbo-sized cock, and make a woman out of her. I wished that once she found out that I was referring to her on my twitter, we could have talked about it between us instead of having her needlessly flame me on twitter (what a cunt). And it was kind of strange to me why she did that because most girls in a similar scenario I would assume, would have just kept it to themselves, and just ignored the horny person, instead of blatantly declaring it online; nobody would know I was referring to you on Twitter if you didn’t outright say it. So I’m thinking you either wanted to boast that wow, Amos Yee had a crush on me, but still be like hi I’m not a hoe, or you felt embarrassed by my tweets, so you wanted to make me feel even more embarrassed because you are quote unquote ‘savage’; yeah, that’s probably it. I know rochelle likes to be the ‘best burner’ or ‘the most savage one’, but I think I spoiled her groove, I’m way more savage than you dear, which is why I have the popular Youtube channel; I probably wrote the greatest response to a girl trying to humiliate a guy because he has a crush on her ever. Which really rochelle calm your tits, we could have just solved this privately between us, interspersed with really rough sex. Even though she's being this really biased, emotional savage cunt right now, I still really like her. She’s flaming me on Facebook, and now I’m calling out her bullshit and kind of making fun of her, it’s really turning me on (this is the kind of love-hate relationship that makes really good sex, do consider the offer rochelle). And you were were the one who came up to me during the convention and wanted to take the selfie, and you were the one who started a Facebook conversation with me talking about the drama of criticizing other people’s cosplay outfits in the cosplay community (Then afterwards I checked your Facebook profile, looked at your pics and continued talking to you, and then I fell in love :D ) Why do you seem angry and sadistic, complaining and saying I ‘harassed’ you on Facebook? Amos Yee wants to make out with you, you should be honoured. I hope she unblocks me, (and also her friend (you convinced her too huh?)), we have so much more to talk about, and aside from the awkwardness of me wanting to fuck you, we could be good friends. You can totally respect someone as an intelligent person and also want to fuck her; why is there this impression that if you want to fuck someone it’s somehow degrading them? It totally isn’t, at least it shouldn’t be. But say like every other girl that had to deal with a similar situation, rochelle just ignores me for the rest of her life; I get it, I’m really sad, but I understand. If that happens well…. it was fun while it lasted. Bye rochelle, for the short few sweet moments we chatted online, I thought you were pretty amazing :)| 1| 2016-12-17 01:00:27

singapore| forevertired| The whole Amos Yee incident and the aunty calling the cops during AFA a few years back rings a few bells. Some people seem offended just for the sake of it. People just need to be less butthurt about things and realize the world doesn't revolve around them. | 1| 2016-12-14 16:10:43
singapore| Dalziel45| More up and down pitch?  You can't get anymore up and down than Singlish man.   I know people don't like Amos Yee being mentioned, but his Singlish video captures the sg accent precisely. "I want to buy chicken rice". Althought slightly exaggerated for humour or something, the tone and pitch is exactly how most of us pronounce it.  Go listen to how normal Ang mohs(not talk show hosts or celebrities) talk. Sounds like they've been awake for 2 days and just drank too much alcohol almost dou alr. (At least for most of the men.)| 1| 2016-12-14 12:39:32

singapore| pannerin| If men get threatened with rape for saying stuff people don't like, they have nothing to worry about because *obviously* men don't get raped, so it's a 'joke'.  Meanwhile women *do* get raped, so when people threaten to rape them that's more concerning.   Also, when men get attacked online, they are not attacked for being men, but because they say things some people don't like. When women receive rape threats, that's an attack based on gender, an attempt to put women back in their 'place'.   Men are less likely to be stalked physically, or get creepy phone calls. Do you think that happened to Amos Yee? But it can happen with a woman. Women have their faces pornographically manipulated and men don't. Is this SJW or simply being **right**?  And no one thought you were making a rape threat. No one thought you were threatening anybody. Stop being triggered by nothing.| 3| 2016-12-09 02:54:50

singapore| mantism| Amos Yee (yes, sorry for whoever's doing the count-up)  Not Singapore as in just the government, as in Singapore in its entirety. The way many responded to the Amos Yee issue was pretty darn disgusting. I don't really agree with the boy (he had good points, but he chose to overemphasize on the more emotional parts of his rants), but what Singapore as a society replied, I feel, really stained the country. It's at that moment where a little bit of 'Singapore is North Korea' is justified. People demanding Yee to die or be forever jailed etc etc just for defaming the old man was pretty harsh. It also opened up more flaws and loopholes in the Sedition Act, and the all-powerful judge, jury and executioner role the government has.| 30| 2016-12-05 23:58:09

HongKong| starrRiver| The hate speech laws that Amos Yee was arrested under isn't entirely unique to Singapore, although it's probably on the authoritarian side of the spectrum. Remember he wasn't arrested for insulting lee kuan yew. I can literally say fuck lee kuan yew now in this thread. Fuck lee kuan yew. I won't be arrested, because it's not against the law.   Amos Yee was arrested for insulting christians (arguably a religious minority) in a country that split from Malaysia partly due to really violent ethno religious riots in the 60s. Laws reflect a country's historical experience and anti hate speech laws exist in almost every first world country; in this respect the US is the exception. For example holocaust denial is illegal in Germany but not in singapore. But this obviously doesn't make Germany a less free country than Singapore, it just shows that in this area the elected representatives of the German people decided that preventing holocaust denial is a worthy tradeoff for some level of infringement of free speech. the same way the elected representatives in singapore (in unrigged elections, although gerrymandering is a problem) decided, based on the country's historical experience and current ethnic make up, that restricting speech intended only to insult religious groups is better overall for society.   I think there are many areas of law that are much more antithetical to free speech in singapore, such as the lack of a qualified privilege defense for public interest reporting in defamation law. But I think the Amos Yee example, while emotionally compelling, is really a poor example, because anti hate speech law is really one area where I think reasonable people can disagree about the appropriate level restrictions on speech, and is shaped very much by a country's specific historical context.  | 13| 2016-12-03 14:44:40
singapore| mentalwheets| I'm in HK now and yes, I would move to HK (if assuming I got a job here.)  But there are certain things they - and I would - miss. We don't exactly have entertainment culture, but our food culture is rich af - whereas you just eat dim sum/Chinese/Japanese here nearly everyday.  I hate how they harp on Amos Yee all the time though. I mean, he's a teenager, but he has also been fucking racist and sexist and a giant troll. If he did the same thing in HK, he won't be popular either and will be immediately forgotten. (Our government is stupid when it comes to rules)  It's quite telling how they see us though. In my months of being here people have been too polite to tell me how they really think about Singapore but we seem to be a place where they aren't free to do whatever they do at home (speaking freely, marching on the streets, being anti-government). | 8| 2016-12-03 12:39:02
singapore| eloriale| I agree that 'freedom of speech' can be perceived to be better there but honestly, how many of us are persecuted if we say 'screw the government' or whatever the peeps at edmw have been saying? In China/HK, there have been rumors that People mysteriously go missing/jailed if they are too vocal about being anti-government.   People who are presecuted or sued in Singapore (Roy Nerng/Amos Yee) definitely won't reflect well for SG in terms of the international standard for freedom of speech :/ but I rather have someone who can accurately portray facts than someone who skews data to propagate their agenda or someone who spew hate in most of their videos.| 20| 2016-12-03 12:27:01
singapore| drmchsr0| In the States, Amos Yee would either be:  1. Laughed at. 2. Be part of the alt-right. 3. Shitposting in 4chan and failing.  In China he'd be taken at night and either shot, harvested for organs or left to rot in a Chinese gulag.  As for the question, I'd only be trading in one authoritarian government who MIGHT arrest me for an authoritarian government who WILL.  Besides, the political fuckhole known as Taiwan exists.  Translation: Fuck no, the CCP is essentially the PAP writ large and Taiwan still exists, at least in the next 3 years.| 19| 2016-12-03 11:29:13
singapore| eloriale| ... I'm actually quite confused, what brought on the thread in the first place? While the OP's intention is good, it kinda became a major "shit on Singapore" session. Could be just me idk.  Personally, I wouldn't move to HK permanently. It's a great place and all but only as a tourist. I'd like to think that we actually have more freedom of speech and autonomy then them and to be fair, the examples they quoted just showed how ignorant they are of the issues here (and just blindly following whatever their media propagates). How many of them have actually heard the full, original Amos Yee video that borderlined hate speech? Or heard about how he screwed over the guy that paid his bail and helped him?  Eh just because 70% of the population voted for PAP doesn't make it a 'dictatorship' or 'repressive' or someone rigged the votes (maybe they did, I don't know). Singaporeans are notoriously pragmatic, and unless there is a strong opposition party, one that doesn't sensationalise populist idea and actually show up in our neighbourhood to talk to people, it's quite hard to think that most Singaporeans will vote otherwise.   At the expense of sounding like a die-hard and brainwashed PAP fan, I'm just gonna say that I'd be happy to trade some degree of freedom if it means I get stability :/| 34| 2016-12-03 11:16:20
singapore| pingdragon| &gt;The blind deference to authority and allowing them to do whatever they want?  Hmmm... the last time i checked, Singapore is not heading towards total blind deference to authority. There are tons of Amos Yees in singapore in the past and are properly dealt with in the law, this just so happens to be a high profile case because of his youtube videos. Also, the last time i checked, he wasn't charged with criticizing the government, he was charged with hurting religious feelings and defamation/slander. Which in the eyes of every law of most countries, it is a valid case (at least not the hurting religious feelings part). There are tons of people criticizing the government and didn't get charged, opposition parties especially criticize the living shit out of PAP and yet PAP did nth, coz the people criticizing them have valid points and did not do it out of malice which Amos Yee clearly did. So if u want to make your argument sound, pls don't bring up Amos Yee. Bring someone else to the table instead if u want to talk about someone being charged with "criticizing Singapore".   &gt;contempt of court and EP changes  What is wrong with the contempt in court and EP changes? Would you care to explain? Coz i see no problems with it.| 1| 2016-12-02 20:31:17
singapore| drmchsr0| The blind deference to authority and allowing them to do whatever they want?   Might I remind you of the recent changes to contempt of court AND the EP changes.  There's also that time in 2008 when Odex got Singtel to cough up the latter's billing addresses for a paltry sum over "anime piracy". I do not remember the PAP saying anything about that, though a lot of people would assume that the PAP wanted to stay 'neutral' regarding that matter.  Amos Yee has already been physically assaulted twice. Yea, he's a stupud, edgy cunt and that alone is enough reason to hit him. Yes, the retards who hit him were indeed charged with battery and properly punished by the law. But the fact is the motivations behind the assaults were the same: wanting to teach that little shit a lesson for "criticizing Singapore".  These are examples in recent history.

singapore| drmchsr0| Amos Yee is an immature, stupid edgelord. He's basically a bright, neon bullseye the PAP hits and will keep hitting because the people are literally too fucking stupid to realize that he's no different from r/atheism/ and really, why should I listen to a guy who takes his religious education from THE "AMAZING" ATHEIST, a guy who even mainstream atheists hate.  Meanwhile TOC gets gazetted as a political institution, MARUAH gets stonewalled trying to push for electoral transparency and basic UNHRC rights and Catherine Lim quietly gets lawsuits and the people don't know or care. Or the recent changes to the law.| 1| 2016-12-01 16:22:15

singapore| drmchsr0| You are right in saying Singapore isn't Nazi Germany. After all, David Marshall was our first Chief Minister and he was a Jew.  We are not in a war and we certainly are not in Europe.  However, the citizens of Singapore bear a shocking resemblance in terms of attitude to the German citizens in Nazi Germany and indeed, in most authoritian regimes.  And it's even less surprising when you realize we did nothing when JBJ got sued to the ground, we fucking hit Amos Yee for "insulting the government" and we elected the fuck who was in charge of Operation Spectrum. All in the name of survival.  Again, we aren't Nazi Germany right now. And certain aspects of the NSDAP regime will never materialize, like the Holocaust or the war thing. However, the attitude is there, and it's already bad news.| -2| 2016-12-01 12:32:57

worldnews| BR123456| Hm. It's definitely not as bad as China though imo. It's just some issues of freedom of speech, acts etc (you can look up the case of Amos Yee, although tbh it's his own fault for putting things forward in such a rude way) and a lot of censorship (not to the extent of China but wayyyy too much compared to other Western countries). The government just comes across as quite controlling, which earned Singapore the nickname of a nanny-state. It's like they want to nose their way into the daily lives of citizens, especially in the past. Things like the chewing gum ban and the Sedition Act that criminalizes speech that causes hostility, etc.   Being a tourist in Singapore is great though, lots of food, nice places to visit, lots of food. Hope you had fun here lol. | 1| 2016-11-25 04:03:08
AskReddit| GunnerFegel| 1) So Singapore has poor human rights because it has restrictions on foreign sponsoring for Pink Dot? I mean, apart from the annual event at Speaker's Corner, there aren't really much news regarding the LGBT community. And about the ban on gay sex, it's not like there is 24/7 surveillance on what you do in your bedroom, and it's not like anybody would care anyway (except for the government). I'd say, if you want to do it, keep it discreet.  2) It's true there is a lack of protection for foreign domestic workers because the Act doesn't cover them.  3) Sure, most media is partially controlled by the government, but you still see dissent just about anywhere. I'm sure you were also thinking about the Amos Yee case while typing this out. Some would say that he shouldn't be punished for voicing his opinion, but the way he voiced them were incredibly distasteful, especially his Lee Kuan Yew video. He could've done it so much differently, and yet his title is literally titled "Lee Kuan Yew is Finally Dead!" Like, come on, our founding father just died. Even if he didn't get arrested, he would be extremely unpopular among Singaporeans for such blatant disrespect.  4) I'm not sure how this shows a low level of human rights. Because we have corporal punishment and the death sentence? Or is it because we punish foreign nationals who break the law in our country the same way we punish our own citizens, like Michael Fay? I would argue that it is partially due to these harsh penalties that we are able to enjoy such a low crime rate.| 1| 2016-11-24 23:59:16
singapore| _blackcrow| Does anyone think that the same courts and laws putting Amos behind are actually protecting him at the same time as well? Ok, I've gone full white here, might be the 2 years worth of conditioning and the many more years of retraining after that.   Anyways what I'm trying to point out here is that, without the laws in the country, he probably be murdered just because he have said so many offensive stuff. You should really check out what the kid has posted outside of the infamous LKY/Margaret.   I'm not a big fan of yee as you can probably tell and free speech comes with using it responsibly. Imagine Amos yee practicing his free speech in person, repeating what he has mentioned in his videos in regards to religion in the middle of Singapore or your choice of any country, he can still go home safely and not fear repercussions?| 0| 2016-11-24 23:50:42

Hence their silence in ongoing trials about Amos Yee (especially with regard to his later videos) XD  I just think he is misguided. State's policies though partly justified was too harsh. However salient his arguments may be, it just loses out to all of his other less admirable points.| 2| 2016-11-24 02:35:07
singapore| very_bad_advice| Inherent within the argument for free speech is that it must also  logically allow the argument that "free speech must be abated/curtailed", or else it would be hypocritical.  Everyone has the right to criticize Roy and Amos. Even make personal attacks on them - which they have.   What I would like to see is that the state machinery - that is state media and judiciary not be used against them.  I am also free to disagree with people who rail against them for their rhetoric, and state they are incorrect in their assessment. I am not free to use violence or force them to change their opinion though - though some extreme viewpoints say otherwise. Free Speech is not an inherent right despite what certain people say, it's a right that needs to be fought for and defended and the boundaries are created by civil society.  To summarize, my opinion is my own - you can choose to feel what you want about Amos Yee and Roy Ngerng. I am also free to feel dispassionate when people feel that they shouldn't speak up, rather than understand the arguments they are trying to make, but logically speaking I can't do anything more (e.g. prevent them from speaking up or asking for a law that bans people from impinging someone for suggesting someone should not speak out) or I would be hypocritical  | 9| 2016-11-24 01:35:07
singapore| Wheat-gen-stein| &gt; That the majority of Singaporeans actually criticize Amos Yee  But isn't that the point of free speech? I am of the view that Amos or Han Hui Hui can criticise all they want. But it's a two-way street. Those who disagree should be allowed to criticise them as well. Of course, not to the point of assault. On that point, I also think there's a difference between criticism and outright lying. I was in a stats class where the prof used Roy's statistical inference as an example of bad statistical methods, he refrained from saying anything about Roy himself, but he thought it was an interesting case-study. At the height of his support, my peers who are social science undergrads really hated him for his bad stats and would always remark, jokingly, that the standards of NUS FASS has really dropped. Problem is, most of the public don't have that sort of technical knowledge to figure it out for themselves.| 21| 2016-11-24 01:08:35
singapore| very_bad_advice| How was Amos Yee asking to be punched when he was walking to court, and embraced against his will while he was shopping?   As for Roy's accusation against CPF, there is certain merit in sections on what he says. CPF was initially meant to act as a certain enforced savings, but year on year you can see the charter change to suit the needs of the government in charge. In other words there is a certain opaqueness to the operation of the CPF. His words are dodgy only because we are not privy to all the facts and we shall never be privy because we do not demand. What we should call for is a FOIA, that will allow us to examine the veracity of his claims to debunk it in its entirety not attack certain sections that he can only postulate based upon the best guesstimate.  It's easy to be critical about unpopular ideas, it's tough to defend unpopular ones, so i don't see the reason we need special protections against Roy's vitriol if it is not what most people think. I doubt they are asking to shut their critics, but I also doubt they are specifically asking to go through the meat grinder of the state machinery - libel suits and jailtime.  How did opposition use the rules to get ahead? I never heard them actually "get ahead"| 13| 2016-11-23 22:05:24
singapore| very_bad_advice| My opinion is that Singaporeans are treating people like Roy Ngerng and Amos Yee incorrectly and are being taken for a ride by the more conservative powers that be in our society.  There shouldn't be a law that allows us to persecute people for questioning and making statements that impinge upon the integrity of the most powerful within our nation - be it political leaders, religion or racial identity.   The only speech that should be viewed warily are speech that prey upon the weakest in society, the minorities, the disenfranchised and the politically powerless.  By allowing our laws which are created by those with power to dictate how we without power voice our emotions it leads to unpresented anguish to boil beneath the surface of the calm social contract.  That the majority of Singaporeans actually criticize Amos Yee and even go so far as to assault him in public (TWICE?) just makes me dispassionate about the civil society in Singapore.  Whether we agree or not to the content of his message or the way he says it, we have to realize that society advances from the fringes, not the center. I don't know if he is the fringe we will advance in, but we are actively discouraging youth of with strong thoughts from voicing it out.| 73| 2016-11-23 21:14:47

science| new_weather| I understand you entirely and I had the same opinion. Now I live here and I cannot argue with the outstanding quality of life. There are tradeoffs to everything. The freedoms I give up (the freedom to offend others) are compensated by freedoms I receive (the freedom to not be offended, which sounds shit until you consider "offended" as being angry you've been sexually harassed/assaulted/robbed, and I never ever have to worry about that here).  The jailing of Amos Yee is not admirable but he didn't get jailed for speaking ill of the ex-PM. He was jailed for making "derogatory and offensive remarks about Christians" on youtube... if he had left off his religious rant it would have simply been good local drama, not jail time.  Everywhere is shit. There is no utopia. You just have to find what ideals you agree with and what kind of life you want to live and what risks you want to take. Everyone is different in what they are looking for.| -2| 2016-11-14 16:45:09

singapore| exonomial| I am happy that the Courts helped to create a legal precedence to ensure protection for LGBT individuals.  But the implication of this ruling also implies that the legislature / judiciary continues to have the **right to censor individuals**. If you think about what happened to Amos Yee a couple of weeks ago, this ruling basically categorized sexual orientation in the same set of 'insensitivities' as ethnicity and religion. What this might mean is that while LGBT individuals are more protected, the underlying tensions / disagreements will become only unspoken.  Ultimately, is this really a victory for freedom of speech? Shouldn't we also recognize that there should be other ways to promote tolerance and compassion instead of adopting legal measures? Perhaps it's not about whether he is *deserving*, but addressing why our moral compass is set up that way to begin with.| 23| 2016-11-04 14:53:42
singapore| [deleted]| I thought that Singapore prided itself in being the top? So why is the press ranking to low?      PAP suing Catherine Lim for criticising it, muzzling of The Online Citizen by forcing it to change its categorisation, jailing Amos Yee, shutting down of The Real Singapore, and many more evidence to show that the ruling party is intolerant of political debates and mind standing against criticism. Is the ruling party scared of the actual facts on the ground? Is that why they are not forthcoming with information?    One way for the ruling party to make amends is to be more open and make more information more freely available. The ruling party should be understanding the people, not the other way around.| 1| 2016-11-03 23:24:17
singapore| NO_LAH_WHERE_GOT| **EDIT: Added edits in this comment to clarify, since so many people are misunderstanding what I'm saying. Not removing any earlier lines, just adding lines in bold.**  Anti-censorship folks are usually intellectual, educated types who can think critically, sniff out BS, analyze intent and so on. **(This does NOT mean that pro-censorship are necessarily dumb or anti-intellectual. Some pro-censorship folks are dumb. Some anti-censorship folks are also dumb, but those usually aren't the ones writing lengthy commentary pieces about the importance of anti-censorship. Rather, they tend to be the ones performing a 'fuck govt control' identity, without ever having been responsible for the maintenance of an organization or community. Anyway – I think it's a given that some of the smartest people in Govt are pro-censorship, not because they like the idea of suppressing things, but because they've seen first-hand how impressionable people can be.)**  If you spend any time on the Facebook comments sections of any of our news organizations, though, it becomes clear that lots of people are troublingly impressionable.   So censors and anti-censors are talking past each other. The censors are usually hesitant to draw attention to the socioeconomic/class nature of the problem, and the anti-censors (like most people) usually live in social bubbles.  Put another way, censorship isn't about silencing people like Amos Yee- it's about curating and sanitizing the context for people like the guys who slapped them.  Of course, there's the additional concern of who regulates the censors, and whether censorship will be abused for narrow political interests.  But I think anybody who's ever actually had to be responsible for a community quickly learns that you have to have some form of moderation. Otherwise the conversations are hijacked by the loudest, ugliest members of the group (eg Brexit).  There are no easy answers, there is no rulebook, and some people will always be hurt or upset regardless of how you act or refrain from acting. (**But the point, of course, if you're in charge and trying to do a good job, is to try and steer things towards the best possible outcome for all, however you define that.**)| 14| 2016-11-03 10:22:01

Enough_Sanders_Spam| magneticanisotropy| No, it wasn't.   Singapore is quite a different place than what you see it as, and extremely different than the US.  It's a very multi-racial and multi-religion place (with large Malay, Chinese, and Indian populations, and as for religions, Christian, Buddhist, and Muslim).    Amos Yee, the case you are referring to, was sentenced for Yee was arrested and charged with "intention of wounding the religious feelings of Christians", obscenity, and "threatening, abusive or insulting communication."  In the video he definitely mocked LHL's father (LKY), but also Christian beliefs and added oscene images of LKY + Margaret Thatcher.  Both of these are punishable in Singapore.    Under western audiences, this is definitely contrary to what we feel should be allowed under freedom of speech.  In Singapore, in part, these laws are the result of a large amount of ethnic strife experienced at times, and meant to help the different communities coexist.    It has it's downsides, and a lot of (just) criticisms, but at the same time, it is also very effective and works for Singapore.  Note:  I believe this is the case from living in Singapore, and what I've read on the subject and experienced while here.  Wikipedia also supports a lot of this (easy source).  However, this definitely doesn't make me an expert on the subject, so I could definitely be wrong.  Please correct me if I am.| 8| 2016-10-28 15:44:12

singapore| force_emitter| A large proportion of Singaporeans are sensitive and easily offended, as you may have already observed from examples like the Amos Yee fiasco. So I guess we just don't have the maturity as a society to handle jokes that could potentially harm racial/religious sensitivies. I for one am all for "prejudice equality", where every race/ethnicity gets shit on equally, but it could only work in an idealized world where everyone can stop taking things as seriously and can take what they dish out.  So yeah, if something like a slightly deranged, attention-seeking child's trolling can threaten the very foundations of a society, then I guess "PC" is the way to go, for now at least.| 2| 2016-10-26 18:57:49

AskReddit| Shaunleewenjie| To be honest it's rather warranted due to our situation.   I live in Singapore where we all are technically immigrants and we have a diverse culture, Indians, Malaysians, Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, Westerners etc. We all learnt to live in harmony and there has not been any conflict between race or religion for a very Long time.   If people were allowed to openly criticise religion it would probably lead to a lot of tension and conflict between the races and religions   Oh and we did get criticised and condemned by other countries, such as China. On a side note, we seem to currently be the most expensive country to live in in the world and the country with the least racism and conflict between race or religion currently   EDIT: see Amos Yee| 2| 2016-10-12 00:02:19

If you were in America, where their first amendment is free speech, with the only exception being when someone incites actual violence, Amos Yee would be absolutely fine.

worldnews| gnovos| I'm not angry at all, you just have literally zero sense of sardonic humor.  Or maybe it's a language barrier situation, I dunno.  Amos Yee is just a kid, you know.  The fact that he's been capable of generating *a lot* of global attention over this is impressive in a way that maybe you don't fully grasp.  You just try and garner this much attention yourself and you'll see what a feat it really is.  All he needs is a little focus and direction and he'll become formidable.

You literally are Amos Yee, it's just that your side is currently in power, so you are blind to it.  Someday the balance of power will shift and it will be *you* in jail for insulting Amos' camp, at which point what possible moral recourse do you have?  None, because your policy is sit down and shut up, regardless of the law.  So prove you can do what you want others to do.

You're largely starting from an assumption of individualistic rights and freedoms, whereas, as many other commenters have pointed out, many other societies start with the collective before thinking about the sort of individual liberties that make sense.  &gt; I see. Amos Yee has been encouraging racial rioting. Well, in that case, I see your point. Otherwise, I fucking do not.  I'll assume you're not being deliberately obtuse, but the point is that historical circumstances has led to a distrust in the idea that the negative consequences of free speech can be managed; one doesn't have to be *deliberately* encouraging racial rioting to be creating ethnic conflict. The idea is that the risk of ethnic conflict is to be addressed early on instead of allowing conflicts to work themselves out. It's a paternalistic argument that probably overestimates the continued risk several decades on, but it's not **without reason** like you insist, but rather being extremely risk-averse regarding this issue.| 2| 2016-09-30 16:15:06

Amos Yee has been basically a slanderous troll for a long time. His views have some modicum of validity which would not have been an issue by themselves, but people are missing out on the fact that he was intentionally trying to incite anger by going on very long, very intentionally offensive and very incoherent rants right after Lee's death.  Also, I highly doubt most Singaporeans would call past policies abuse, especially relative to the stuff other countries come up with.

singapore| gyxorz| 'We aren't allowed to say anything' - i wouldn't exactly qualify what Amos said as merely 'anything'.  I do somewhat agree with your general point though. A society / community matures through exposure to contentious issues rather than sweeping it under the rug. I think we've reached a juncture where we need to accelerate our transition towards accommodating liberalism, certainly a lot more than the government currently does.  I also agree with having the appropriate response towards the Amos Yee issue. Those who snigger and propose violence and retribution serve only to condemn and not to rehabilitate. It's about making themselves feel better, not about building a more constructive society. These people are of the worst kind. I do think however that they are a minority.  I would however say that whilst we may give the benefit of the doubt - that Amos reserves his right to express himself 'freely and peacefully', whatever agenda he pursues does not serve any good or higher purpose other than to stir possible unrest and sow possible discord amongst races / religions. It is here that we must consider the balance between rights and responsibilities.  It isn't as if Amos doesn't have other means to approach his issue. It might not be the best of analogies, but have you ever seen an argument / discussion that reached a peaceful and constructive conclusion when one party put forth his point in a highly sarcastic, haughty, vindictive and antagonizing manner?| 6| 2016-09-29 23:48:27
singapore| clrjhnn| Where are your stats on "jailtime in Singapore means you can't get a decently-paying job ever etc."? I can easily make that claim for any other country. And the claim of social stigma being a social death-sentence isn't sufficient to oppose a jail term at all. The answer is to address the stigma as a society, not avoid sending people to jail altogether.  Also, regardless of his sentence, Amos dug his own grave when he made himself such a controversial online figure and said all sorts of ignorant things. Do you honestly think that any company in their right mind would hire Amos Yee (as he is now)? He is a liability and a loose canon. People are fired from their jobs for saying things similar to what he said on social media, so let's not act as if the law just ruined his future.  "since almost no one hires ex-cons"?

Racial and religious harmony is very much a social construct, certainly not part of the natural order.   Beneath the blanket of social stability, we are all free to criticize how small-time this seems. But our social stability amongst other important stuff has precisely been the product of a zero-tolerance policy. Our right to free speech curtailed for dogmatically pragmatic purposes.  The greatest bastion of democracy has struggled for decades to balance liberty and freedom with racial (religious?) harmony. More than 50 years after MLK's iconic speech however, this balancing act has shown itself to have failed.  This Amos Yee saga showcases a part of our judicial system that is extreme. Uncomfortable, bordering on unethical. But it is a formula that has served us well thus far, for better or for worse in the long run.| 47| 2016-09-29 15:47:06

singapore| Awin1997| Although Amos Yee did a couple of ridiculous stuff, I think putting a 17 year old in jail is sending out a wrong message and will forever affect him. The government should instead try counselling him or trying other means| 17| 2016-09-29 12:32:26
singapore| 3lungs| Offense is taken not given.  You take offense at something someone says, even though someone might not have the intention to offend. Example: You say 'wah this chicken chop not bad'. Vegan gets offended. Vegan took offense. You didn't mean anything.  Amos Yee is doing it for the attention. He has been, and he knows it (which was why he said he was gonna be at some place to do some shit, and when the reporters turned up, he claimed he trolled them or some shit).  Always funny when Singaporeans give him the attention he wants/craves. Even more hilarious was after he became 'well known'. People would go to his YouTube channel/Twitter/blog, watch his videos, be offended, and make police report. WTF bruh?!?! It's like a religious person knowingly walking into a atheism gathering and getting offended.| 9| 2016-09-29 09:58:41
singapore| whywhywhywhy12| Please don't be Amos Yee ver 2. Nobody wants to sue you, so calm down. Perhaps we could ask Indonesia to give Cindy citizenship instead.   In the long run, for the country, it'll be bad to give people like Cindy citizenship because it becomes an incentive for people to make morally hazardous decisions, knowing that the government might pardon them.  I am sorry that the Singapore education system did not serve you well that you failed to realised what it takes to govern Singapore well, if you are what you claim to have, grown to love Singapore over the years. I hope your decision was made in favor of Singapore's future.| -1| 2016-09-27 22:25:57

dataisbeautiful| 9kz7| &gt; Singaporean here. Amos Yee represents a lose-lose case for the authorities, there's really no way they could have reacted without drawing flak. By arresting him, they reinforce the image of Singapore as a repressive regime in the eyes of the Western world (which I largely dispute, though I won't dive into it here) as well as earn the ire of liberals here. However, if they hadn't arrested him, the consequences would not have been minor either, for several reasons: &gt;  &gt; 1. He openly attacked Christianity, and all offensive remarks on race and religion are a strict no-no. A Chinese manager once lost her job over insensitive remarks about the minority Malays, and bloggers have been charged over anti-Muslim remarks. The police cannot compromise on this, because **the sacrosanct status of race and religion are a fundamental part of Singapore's identity.**  &gt;  &gt; 2. **Multiple police reports were made (over 20) by members of the public, and they cannot be seen as being soft (which is something that some of the older generation accuse the present government of being**; Lee Kuan Yew would never have allowed the foreign worker strike and riot that occurred two years ago to happen, they reason). Remember the Koran-burning pastor in the US? He'd have been jailed in Singapore the moment he suggested such a thing. &gt;  &gt; 3. **Lee Kuan Yew is a revered figure, heavily respected even by the political opposition.** Nearly 450,000 people filed past his coffin during the lying in state, and 1.2 million (more than 1/3rd of the entire citizen population) paid their respects at various community sites. Even the most hardcore of his supporters were stunned at the immense outpouring of grief, a spectacle in an ordinarily tranquil Singapore that hasn't been seen for half a century and likely never will be seen again. **The leader of the Opposition, Low Thia Khiang (who contrary to the stereotype that all opposition figures are ruthlessly destroyed, actually led a team that unseated the popular former Foreign Minister, George Yeo) delivered a tribute in Parliament that recognised LKY as the irreplaceable founder of the modern nation while noting that his use of repressive tools made him imperfect. The longest ever serving Opposition MP, Chiam See Tong was one of the pallbearers for the state funeral and came to pay his respects during the lying in state, despite being confined to a wheelchair by a stroke he had years ago**. The authorities CANNOT be seen to ignore such a blatant insult on such a sacred figure, especially since the country was still in an official state of mourning. It would destroy their credibility in the eyes of the ordinary Singaporean if they let such a monumental act of idiocy pass unpunished.  &gt;  &gt; 4. Amos Yee dangerously twists and even invents (yes, invents!) facts to suit his view that Lee Kuan Yew was a corrupt dictator that Singapore would be better off without. Ironically, the very fact that he lives a comfortable at least middle-class life with electronic gadgets and a shelf full of books is something he probably owes to the changes that LKY and his team of able ministers wrought. I'm only 19, and in the past ten years I've already seen unimaginable changes happening as Singapore develops; I live in a condominium where my mother lived in a kampong (rural village), my grandparents had to sell tidbits to supplement their income while I'm chasing a career in ecology. Singaporeans cannot tolerate deliberately lying to the world that the man who utterly changed their lives was a self-serving malicious corrupt dictator, when all the evidence points to the contrary. **We believe strongly that "thou shalt not bear false testimony" should be enforceable by law.**  &gt;  &gt; 5. Singaporeans have been travelling all over the Western world to study, work and holiday for decades; a number greatly disproportionate to our population ends up in Ivy League colleges and Oxbridge. The Internet means that there is no way the true state of the outside world can be hidden from us. To imply that we've all been hoodwinked is well, quite frankly an insult to us, so forgive us if we don't rush to defend his right to rant about how shitty Singapore is when we know full well that it isn't perfect, but it sure as hell is a sight better than nearly any other city in the world. I have **a friend who one would classify as deeply anti-government and who would love to migrate as soon as he can (he has a place in MIT) - and he told me quite simply that Amos Yee was just asking for it.** In other words, despite all our exposure to the systems of other countries, there is a deep understanding in Singapore that this is simply something you do not do; it violates the social understanding on which our nation is built. The police can't *not* arrest him.  &gt;  &gt; TLDR: The police would have lost more in the form of the respect of the public if they hadn't arrested him than if they had.   taken from /u/Penguin609 [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/30t56d/singaporean_police_arrests_amos_yee_a_17yearold/cpwitp7)  To add on, I know many people here would argue that freedom of speech is the most important thing in the world and then 'hurting somebody's feelings because they insulted their religion' is ridiculous. I understand the view point, however  &gt; [Singapore is] an artificial city state that has been developed into an economic powerhouse over the past sixty years. The agenda of the people in charge of Singapore is to focus on economic growth, keep the peace between its extremely diverse citizenry, and avoid being swallowed up by Malaysia.  &gt; They've got an extremely diverse population, so they've got all of these laws about maintaining civility and respect, so as not to upset the apple cart, laws that encourage everyone to live together peacefully. Being so small, and in the shadow of much larger countries like Indonesia and Malaysia, they really can't afford to allow any social discord, ethnic tribalism, or religious sectarianism to take root. The second the place starts to fracture along ethnic-religious lines, its doomed.  taken from /u/GlortabOhara [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4l5fw5/singapore_teenage_blogger_amos_yee_faces_8_new/d3lcm9v)  So was was he sentenced with?  &gt; **Amos Yee was not charged because he insulted our government, or that he insulted Lee Kuan Yew. He was charged with three offences. The first two were related to comments he made about Christianity, comparing LKY to Jesus and saying that both are charlatans. The third relates to an obscene photo he photoshopped and posted of LKY having anal sex with Margaret Thatcher.** Let's discuss his main offence first, his comments about religion. &gt;  &gt; Singapore is tiny compared to the US, and even to some US cities. One video reaches further here than it does over there. Like the US, Singapore has a history of racial riots, although ours had a religious element too. [The 1964 race riots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_race_riots_in_Singapore) &gt; [The 1969 race riots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_race_riots_of_Singapore) &gt;  &gt; Remember the Rodney King riots in LA? Or the Ferguson riots in St Louis? They had devastating effects on both cities. The US as a whole could recover from the damage, because your country is huge. But imagine if that happened in Singapore. The consequences would be catastrophic for us if something similar happened here. **Our culture is to err on the side of caution with regards to sensitive topics that could lead to extreme backlash, because if it happens to us just once, our reputation and indirectly our economic strengths would vanish overnight.** &gt;  &gt; Singapore has a large community of Muslims, and the authorities have previously arrested and charged bloggers for making offensive comments about race and religion. [Blogger faces sedition charges](http://singaporerebel.blogspot.sg/2005/09/17-year-old-to-face-sedition-charges.html) &gt;  &gt; So you see, Amos made his video at the worst possible time. It was at the height of national mourning, and emotions were raw. His video therefore went viral, and a lot of Christians took notice of the offensive comments he made. **The authorities *cannot* do nothing, because that would leave our Christian community making comparisons to previous cases where bloggers were arrested for insulting Muslims. We cannot afford to give the impression that one religious group has special treatment over another.** So at the very least, Amos had to be arrested and his case had to be investigated. &gt;  &gt; Now in a perfect world, people would understand that Amos is your typical awkward teenager with poor social skills, and his video was just a deliberate attempt at gaining notoriety by pissing people off. In a perfect world, people could separate their grief at LKY's death and look at Amos's video objectively. But as LKY was fond of saying, **Singapore deals with the world as it is, not how we'd like it to be.** Given the 'perfect storm' of factors, he had to be arrested.  taken from /u/FinnSolomon [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/30ylfs/amos_yee/cpx918y)| 3| 2016-09-20 20:30:43

singapore| mchlyxhn| Late to the party, but let me add my two cents anyway.  I find that fakers have very obvious tells. Firstly, they tend to make odd mistakes, such as stressing the wrong syllables (e.g. re-FRID-gerator), mispronouncing certain syllables and letters (such as turning their R's into L's, not pronouncing the h in "th", etc.). You can tell that they are self-conscious and sometimes speak deliberately, not in a way that makes them seem intelligent or thoughtful, but in a way that shows that they have to continuously catch themselves to prevent slipping into their natural accent (this pertains to Singaporeans especially because the local accent is very different to the posh London accent or an "American" accent that some people might pretend to have). They have certain words that they can pronounce perfectly in that accent, compared to the less natural manner of speech for other words, phrases, and sentences (e.g. a lot of people can say "G'day mate!", "biscuits and tea", etc., but won't be able to speak fluently in those accents).  The most obvious tell of all is really just the poor grammar and vocabulary fakers have. It's common for fakers to pronounce a hard U in "lettuce", have poor sentence structure, limited vocabulary (either because they aren't confident in how to pronounce many words in their fake accent, or they just don't know that many words), etc. It's a bit of a chicken and egg situation because older generations who are English-educated tend to be successful and have what you'd call the "upper crust" accent, and thus most people associate that accent with someone who is successful, causing a lot of people to copy the accent, which gave birth to the fake ang moh accent, which then caused people to associate that accent with being a phony. However, you can put a fake next to someone with a natural accent and you'll hear a world of difference.  With regards to the examples you've listed: Tharman, LKY, and LKY's grandson are all English educated, so it's only natural for them to have a different sounding accent because of the different culture they've been exposed to during their formative years, and in Tharman and Lee Sheng Wu's case, I don't believe either of them speak their mother tongue, so there's not a lot of crossover with the local accents. The local "upper crust" accent is essentially just a very clear, crisp way of speaking, similar to the Northeastern/Midwestern American accent aka the news anchor accent, which is why they're sometimes regarded as such. I've found that a lot of english educated senior citizens have this manner of speaking that makes them sound more distinguished. My english tuition teacher was an english educated Indian man, and he spoke somewhat like Tharman, minus the posh influence.  The Stephanie girl was born and/or raised in Sydney, no? So her accent is a natural Sydney accent, which can be hardly classified as either a phony "ang moh" accent or an "upper crust" accent.  Benjamin Kheng has essentially what you'd call an "upper crust" accent.  As far as Amos Yee goes...he's trained himself to speak that way. It's not necessarily fake, per se, but he quite evidently pours it on thick when speaking in front of a camera. It's not upper crust either, since he's just trained himself to speak in another accent, instead of naturally developing a different accent due to speaking well. There's no real reason why his accent is *that* thick, considering he's a 16 year old boy who's spent most of his life in front of a computer.| 5| 2016-09-14 23:40:42
singapore| myepicdemise| &gt; Amos Yee is easy to understand, though. Yet many people said he fakes an American accent.   My only conclusion is that some Singaporeans have a sort of crab syndrome.

KotakuInAction| HariMichaelson| Yeah...but you could be lying.  Disclaimer: I'm not in any way suggesting or asking you do the following; even if you posted a video of you and your wife being intimate with each other, all that proves is that two women did something with each other. Doesn't prove anything about the sexuality of either woman one way or the other.   Now, there *is* neuroscience out there that blows Milo's claim apart, yet no one, including the people who actively despise Milo, ever seem to use it when challenging him, even though Milo himself has said that all the left has to do to crush him in any debate is present evidence any time he says something that's bullshit. He's throwing them a gimme and they never, ever take it for some reason, and now he's hooked nearly everyone in this thread.  He's like that Youtuber Amos Yee who couldn't stop laughing because he legitimately convinced people that we have a moral obligation to legalize the creation and distribution of child porn, just to see if he could, or Godfrey Elfwick who managed to get #wrongskin trending.

When Rupert Murdoch, owner of News Corp, noted asshole and arguably one of the most evil men around (that it took the son of a fascist, yes that Max Mosley, son of Sir Oswald Mosley, founder of the British Union of Fascists), praises our media environment, you know we need to start doing some soul searching.| 16| 2016-09-05 22:31:55
singapore| Brainroots| The perception that I have is that when the government clamps down on free speech, Singaporeans don't react by feeling the government is corrupt.

The kid who would be lost in a sea of other kids saying stupid stuff on the internet if he lived in the west.  I nevertheless agree with your statement.

Look at the election agendas of BJP in the last elections. Or that of parties that won in the state elections recently. People vote for positive change largely.  No, I said before that every good news that India have made, they get bogged down by other issues like infrastructure and poverty etc etc.  "While living in India I traveled extensively in remote rural areas to see first-hand local farmers' living conditions. But it was not until assigned to the government of Baishui County in Shaanxi Province, an underdeveloped rural area of China, that I saw the fundamental differences between life in the countryside of China and of India. In China's villages, banners saying, "To get rich, first build roads" and "The family planning policy is great and girl children are as good as boys" are ubiquitous. Most of the posters seen in India's rural areas, however, bear the slogan "vote for me" beneath the logos of various political parties. A visiting Indian expert in Baishui County told me that government cadres in China personally understand the needs of farmers and offer their help, whereas most Indian cadres think about farmers only at times of elections when they need their votes."  http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/ctenglish/se/txt/2010-07/06/content_283473.htm  It's a good read on why so many of India's poor stays poor despite so many efforts to lift them out of poverty.  &gt;When idiot kids like Amos Yee stop being jailed for voicing opinions, I'd have some respect for Singapore and its political process. Until then the company can suck it.  Stuff like that is still happening around the world like what happened in Saudi Arabia, other gulf regimes and Russia.

singapore| drmchsr0| I won't disagree with the sliding scale thing for freedom of speech.  However, the fact is, Singapore has not ratified the UNHRC, will openly disregard the UN Charter for the Rights of the Child (as seen with Amos Yee), has successfully sued rival politicians (and winning), deported several foreigners for disparaging remarks that would be considered nonissues in... NATO-Aligned countries, at least until recently, and oh, silencing critics via lawsuits and arrests. Nevermind that some of them were clearly asking for it.  It's hard to use a sliding scale in Singapore.| 2| 2016-08-17 20:11:32
singapore| drmchsr0| It's more than just foreign talent. Some of them are terrible people to be around, and even the FTs themselves agree on that.  Also, a government's policies and laws shapes a society. You are right in saying the PAP's policies and laws have shaped Singapore society into the perfect, willing "always vote PAP" populace they want.  And yet, it's still not perfect. You can't just beat xenophobes into obedience. This is how we get Amos Yee and Roy Ngerng.| -2| 2016-08-17 11:44:57

SargonofAkkad| Robinette-| Wekukuknow, or however the name of the Islamic Prankster Youtuber is, said in one of his response videos to Amos Yee something about "how Islamic slavery wasn't that bad because especially Islamic slaves were actually treated well".

tytonreddit| draphael111| Often times people accuse the left of having extreme outbursts of PC outrage, which is certainly true. When fringe liberals say that cartoonists should not publish offensive anti-Muslim cartoons because it could cause outrage that is being 'regressive.' If we assume that the term is used in the conventional sense (i.e to regress to a previous state), then it's fair to say that these people are the regressive left.   That being said, it's a completely overblown term and it's become used as a means of exploiting identity politics which many say they are against. It's not unique to the right or left, it's part of the human condition to brand a group as dangerous, horrible, etc. Cenk may have said some things that weren't accurate regarding terrorists (i.e they do it because they have doubts about the theological text, not necessarily because they are atheists as some smear him saying), that isn't necessarily true. Sometimes religion can be the pure motive for terrorist acts and horrible means of thinking, but it's not always that. Any time it seems that acts of Muslim violence are committed many just assume it's the religion, when often times it's a mixture of factors. Take the original PLO which was a secular-quasi socialist group made up of largely Muslims who fought for a clear political goal, it had little to do with religion. A group like Boko Haram on the other hand certainly does, although that does not completely nullify any political grievances they may have.  The problem I see with what Dave Rubin is doing is that he is attempting to label all those who disagree with him as 'regressive.' People don't disagree with the idea that you bring on guests with differing views, but he refuses to challenge them at all. You should not provide a platform for certain beliefs (i.e climate change denial), as it alters the conversation merely for the perception of balance. He doesn't have to challenge them directly, rather he can bring up some points that are contrary to what the guest says and it can certainly still be civil.   Also the term 'regressive left', minimizes the role that is played by the 'regressive right.' If regressive means regression or moving back then we can certainly see that in a figure like Donald Trump. He bans certain media organizations from his events, he sues the onion (a clearly satirical site), and sues Bill Maher for a joke. He wants censorship, which is often something that the left is accused of which isn't quite fair. This is not undermining the fact that there are those in leftist curricles who demand censorship in the form of not having speakers of differing views, yet to say this represents modern liberalism is just silly.   Kyle Kulinski on secular talk (TYT affilate), I think covers this quite well. He points out cases where the left acts in 'regressive' fashions, as well as where the right does the same. Both are a problem, but for Dave Rubin to simply ignore it on the right to appease his fans (or maybe he actually believes this, it's unfair of me to really claim either way), is deeply disingenuous. He's completely entitled to his own views and that's not the issue, rather he is misrepresenting (which he always and sometimes fairly accuses Cenk of), an issue.   Dave also seems to get quite testy when his own views are challenged. During a discussion about Israel-Palestine during the 2014 military campaign, Dave seemed to take criticism of Israel's policies personally. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp4kw54imkI He's allowed to of course, but the mere idea of a disagreement in this field really seemed to get to him. Being a critic of Israel does not mean you are anti-Semite, if so there are many Jewish anti-Semites. This does not mean there aren't any obviously but to flatly claim that these people criticizing Israeli policy are bigoted (which to be fair he doesn't claim so in the video), is something that would be 'regressive.' As you mentioned criticism of Israel is something he seems to take personally, therefore mentions of it will often be removed since it's personally offensive to him for some reason.   Just for the record I listen to both shows, and they aren't necessarily incompatible. He interviews some interesting people like Tarek Fatah and Amos Yee, and although I wish he would challenge them on some things (less so Fatah not sure what exactly to do so on), it's interesting to hear these people. When you have people on the other hand like Steven Crowder we know what his views are as he already has a platform for it, and some of his views are simply incorrect. He can be personally against abortion, gay marriage, etc, that's fine but there are simply some things like climate change that he is incorrect on.   | 6| 2016-08-06 22:01:06

singapore| pingdragon| &gt;The Government has also managed to convince the vast majority of people that Singapore is very good and there is little to be changed, and this has created a society that, while technologically is forward, is stagnating at a conservative and rather backward stage of societal progress. When you look under this image that the Government has made you see that in fact there are many imperfections, but these imperfections are never really acknowledged as the only people that attempt to discuss them are sadly complete idiots, Amos Yee for example.  Trust me, there are a fk ton of Singaporeans that hates the government. Go to anyone on the streets and i assure you that almost half of the population would give garmen the finger. I like how you use Amos Yee as an example. Amos Yee has no knowledge about politics nor does he respect religious freedom, his opinions does nth to provide any improvement to society as a whole. So i am not sure why ppl like you deem his opinions as valid in any way.  &gt;laws towards homosexuality (which are in my opinion disgusting)  Trust me, the law is only for show, it is only on paper, if you report it to the police they will be probably laugh at u. No one is gonna report a gay couple for doing the dirty unless you have no life. IIRC a Singaporean millionaire is openly gay and he is not arrested for it.   &gt;government censorship of the web and its control of ALL media outlets (which is a good way to suppress freedom of speech)  Pfft, you serious? No government has control over the web, NO ONE. The web is owned by us, not them, they only have power in the web when we are in their "domain". Half the time when we are in the web we are not in their "domain" to be controlled. Media outlets like TV? Pfft no one watches TV now that we have one of the fastest internet speed in the world.  &gt; finally the existence of canings and hangings. All of these 3 things are frowned upon by the UN, a body that represents most nations  If u mean most nations, you mean mostly western nations right? Coz the last time i checked most, if not all Eastern countries have the death penalty. And guess what, they are also in the UN. So i wouldn't say the abolishment of death penalty is supported by "most countries". As much as i want a central government that governs the whole earth, UN is not kind of government.   &gt;The existence of such a large army, which means military spending above spending on welfare, and the outdated idea of National Service also rings alarm bells  Have you look at how small Sg is? An atom bomb is enough to completely level the whole of Sg. Defense is extremely important if we were to survive a war when it breaks out. It is not sth we take lightly coz we know that if we can't properly defend ourselves, there will be no more Sg in less then a week. IIRC the Japanese took over Sg in a week during WW2.   &gt;Please do not comment insults or statements saying I'm ignorant or have no knowledge as this isn't true,   Welcome to the internet, there is no safe space in it. That said, i am not gonna call u ignorant or anything like that. You can treat what i said as a mindless ravings from a lunatic, at the end of the day nth constructive to improve society is done.  &gt;my opinion is just as valid as yours and just because ours might not line up does not mean either is better.

anime| GoatJesus| Well, if the show wanted to present a thesis on how to handle it subtly, that'd be even better tbh. If not trusting the police/police-corruption is common knowledge to a Japanese person, then perhaps presenting a solution would be even more important than presenting the problem itself. I do think, however, that elaborating on an issue for other cultures (not just Western ones,) can have benefits. As much as I dislike Amos Yee and his arguments on youtube, he brought a lot of Singapore's corrupt legal system into the light of many Eastern and Western countries with free speech. So much so, that there's actually real life movements now pushing for that. I think it can be important to illustrate that kind of thing as well for others--even with fiction.  I don't think it would have been that hard to have Satoru convicted for a little while and show us what the process is actually like (maybe, a half an episode?). Anyway, thanks for the conversation. :) I really appreciate it.| 1| 2016-07-19 06:28:32

It's the same freedom of speech (i.e. gahmen won't jail you for expressing your legal views online) that lead to people complaining to the CEO or openly talking about boycotting the company, and the CEO was free to sack an employee who was now a liability.  Of course I don't believe that 'mob justice' should be unlimited (e.g. slapping Amos Yee is illegal), but in this case every action in the chain of events was 100% legal, so how could the government have stopped it from happening? And I'm not comfortable with giving the government powers which would have stopped this entirely legal chain of events, because that would be excessive power.| 1| 2016-07-13 21:15:06

Others just want it to apply to the government. And anyway, in Singapore it seems pretty much noone wants freedom of speech. Judging by the reactions to Amos Yee at least.| -6| 2016-07-13 10:21:15

It's a process.  Who knows. He might just be actually 12 years old or something, in that case he should be congratulated for attempting to socialize in a public discussion forum online. Hes probably a tamer, Bruneian version of Amos Yee. We _should_ give him the benefit of the doubt.

Look at Malaysia, there was a time, Chinese and Malays actually don't point fingers at each other and discriminate but because some asshole can influence idiots to hate the Chinese just because some of them cheated in their business practices it can also happen here. When emotions takes over, rational thinking is disregarded. Like for example Amos Yee.. Now we can just dust it off because its just one guy who needs to get arrested for hate speech.. but when terror strikes and the perpetrators are from ISIS, people will be quick to glance over their Muslim friends or neighbour and had second thoughts. These people who are vocal on their hate speech will increase the influence of those who are already weary.. and it will just get worst from there. This is why the government is so hell bend on arresting anyone discriminating or making hate speeches about other religions or race. A good example is Trump himself.. he has not even been elected to office and his charisma influence racism and the victim are those innocent Muslims.   I understand that the police or security will still have Muslims themselves checking on suspects.. I understand that they're doing their jobs but one critical mistake from the Police will spark some anger and the dam will just burst from there on.  I'm just hoping that everyone regardless of race or religion will unite and stand up against these scums who tries to separate us after being in peace for so long since independence.

SargonofAkkad| treos| the "an" thing is something you see quite commonly in literature (even if it's fan fiction works). that and a distinct lack of contractions such as saying "cannot" instead of "can't".  the above can actually get fairly annoying when your reading a long story. more so when what's being said in a story is in a more casual setting and putting "an" before a word or having characters that never use contractions when speaking makes absolutely no sense.  :/ maybe these grammar related oddities are just something you start noticing more and more as time goes on and when you pay closer attention to what someone is saying.  on the "H" thing however. i don't think that's much of a regional thing though i may be mistaken. i've heard alphaomegasin start saying the letter like that (a rather sudden change for some reason...maybe i'll ask in a comment about that.), Amos Yee, Jim Stirling...that's the US, britain, and singapore so it might not be a regional thing.| 1| 2016-07-06 03:04:44

Is there no line that can be drawn where we can agree that he is, essentially, an asshole and that just because there's a grain of truth to what he says does *not* make his ridiculous edgelord views any more right? | 4| 2016-07-03 22:03:47

SRC_Meta| Nezaus| why did you support the Jihadis censorship and propaganda against Amos Yee? Why have you banned users who support free speech? why have you deleted peoples karma when they call out your bullshit? You seem to be incapable of decent moderation so why don't you return to your weird subreddits and happily jerk yourself off to transexual porn or whatever youre into| 1| 2016-07-02 23:29:45
singapore| NO_LAH_WHERE_GOT| The same way all of the mentioned examples do it – give away content for free, slowly build an audience, then use Patreon to fund future content.   Nobody's really done it yet locally, I think because the opportunity cost is especially high. (Unless you are damn free like Amos Yee.)   If I could go back in time, I would do this in my spare time during my NS days. (But I didn't have such a clear vision then and I wasn't competent enough to make it happen.) But spare time is a really rare commodity these days... Even say $5k/mo for a year would be enough to persuade me to take a sabbatical from work to really grind out content.| 2| 2016-07-02 21:33:21

We have been making note of Drapetomania's antics at censorship and watch reddit die for some time now. He sided against free speech, deleted people's karma, and supported the opinion of a bunch of Malay Islamists against Singapore's Amos Yee. I personally and other reddit posters seem to be very good at getting under is skin, he has openly discussed trying to remove me and other reddit posters totally from the reddit website, I am currently on a 70 day ban from subreddit cancer for calling out his BS. He also has been on the wrong side of subreddit drama, worldnews censorship, ShitPoliticsSays and this thread itself has been deleted....so there you go| 1| 2016-07-02 20:28:38
singapore| the_rumblebee| For some reason, this thread seems absent of the usual "he deserves his right to free speech!" sentiment that I see often in threads about Amos Yee. Is it because we're more pro-LBGT than pro-Christians?| -1| 2016-07-01 15:31:03
singapore| Tusjecht| Just doing what I can to put up some signposts to reddit, there's more to it than just /r/singapore.   Although reddit is primarily a North American website, there's a considerable amount of content created by the rest of the world. There's a sub for almost every country (/r/pyongyang is the joke sub though), non-English subs exist but I don't come across them often. Hobbies (/r/DIY, /r/Music, /r/gaming) have a sub, fanart (/r/ImaginaryNetwork, Imaginary(something) is everywhere, even things as obscure as /r/MechanicalKeyboards have a place. Browsing subs is a bit like browsing the world in your nutshell, and this is just a small selection.   Serious users may consider getting the RES - Reddit Enhancement Suite. It lets you preview your post or comment before submission, monitor # of new comments since you last visited a thread, even make sure NSFW content is or is *not* automatically opened. My personal favourite is the ability to 'tag' users with a short line of description. For example, I'd tag you after reading your comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4pwldx/experience_of_singapore_prison_by_amus_yee/d4oekzg) with 'Give Amos Yee chance', and I'll see it appear whenever I read your comments elsewhere. Never gonna go back after getting RES.  Don't waste too much time on this though. Time spent on reddit is time you're not spending [outside](http://www.reddit.com/r/outside)...*oh wait*.| 1| 2016-07-01 03:31:46
singapore| dizzyluo| &gt; It seems everybody in the LGBT community seems to have this rage against Mr Bryan Lim for posting such comments on facebook especially on the WAAPD FB page.   How many LGBT people do you know to make such an assertion?   &gt; I mean why hold an event that spreads love and understanding of the LGBT when they become pretty vengeful on someone who talk the talk but wont walk the walk?   Whatever Bryan said on Facebook, he could have said it to ANY group and still get charged. It was just his luck that Orlando happened, and his post got brought to the attention of the masses. After all, he was just making a threat that *just happened* to involve the LGBT community.  Secondly, humans are complex. I mean think about it, people can attend *weekly* events that teaches unconditional love and sacrifice yet say such things against a fellow human being on Facebook. This complexity applies for everybody, not just people who are outside of the LGBT community.  So, we are capable of holding an event about love, but that doesn't mean we cannot express negative emotions as well. Call it "vengeful" but I felt the response has been pretty mild if you compare it to how some people went apeshit when their *ideas* were being challenged by Amos Yee. And nope, no one's life was being threatened in that particular case, but people went crazy nonetheless.  If people can go crazy because something in their heads are being challenged, what then do you think is the appropriate response when someone threatens your life?  &gt; IS this fear of being criticised? or Fear of Hate?   It's up to people to make up and dramatize the whole situation, as you have, that's subjective and up to each individual. But the bottom line is, any person who threatens the life of another needs to be reported to the police and be charged.  I don't think fear of criticism has anything to do with this.  See, if someone says on social media that they're a soldier, that they'll protect the nation, and that they're going to gun down the people in your group, **including you**. You will damn well go report that guy to the authorities. And I'm pretty sure your reason of making the report *won't* be fear of criticism or social rejection. Come on.| 6| 2016-06-30 22:35:16

singapore| pingdragon| &gt;To quote Ms Hall: "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it".   and  &gt;That's not how it works. I disagree with this argument, but I think nonetheless than one should be free to say it. The two are not mutually exclusive. Just as you can not believe in a religion and defend the right of people to practice it. That's what freedom is about.  Exactly, you are correct and that is what is happening is Sg. People respect one another for their beliefs and religion. It is people like Amos Yee that actually go out their way to condemn and disrespect them. He express his views on religion which is fine, however when you start attacking other people unjustly because they have different views as you we will have a problem. Hating someone for being morally corrupt is totally different from hating someone who have different views from you. If sth does not affect you in any way, why would you hate them for what they believe in?  Sorry for the last few comments, didn't see liberal democracy there. However, comparing Sg with USA (made up of 2 dominant races) and Europe (mostly 1 dominant race) isn't really saying much. USA's racial differences is still a problem, there are plenty of small scale race riots and toxic communities like KKK, white supremacy and black supremacy groups,etc that is prevalent throughout the country. I admit that racial/religious tensions are improving throughout the years, but with those communities around, they would make it painfully slow. There is a reason that USA ranked 103 in the peace index while Sg is ranked 20.  Most European countries is dominated by either 1 religion or race. So the minorities have little say, not to say that minorities are treated badly, but to say that they are mostly left alone as the dominant race does not control or belittle their communities for stupid reasons.   Compared to Sg, with 3 dominant races and 3~5 dominant religions, i would say we are doing extremely well compared to other countries with our system in place. Having your own opinion is fine, however, if you force your beliefs down people's throats and belittle anyone that doesn't follow you does not make you sound a like freedom fighter, it just make you sound like a dictator. | 0| 2016-06-29 15:57:08
singapore| alittlebitofnonsense| I agree with a lot of what you are saying. And I do think Singapore could be more open in discussing issues like religion.  The problem is that you are defending Amos Yee. There is a line between acceptable and unacceptable speech. I remember the time when news about Amos Yee hit r/news. Basically, there were comments which stated that what Amos Yee says/does in his videos may be constituted to be hate speech/incitement of violence even in more liberal countries. Amos Yee is not in those countries, so we would not know what the results of his actions would be in another country, but it would be interesting to find out.   Yes, speech should be protected, but there is an extent to it. And speech is becoming more free in Singapore. If it were not, this video could not have been produced. Have you heard of OB markers? Race and religion had been topics that had been consciously avoided for so long. That the government will allow this to come out tells you how speech is changing.   Could it be faster? Probably, but governments always take a really long time to make changes, even the rather efficient Singapore one. | 3| 2016-06-29 15:09:04
singapore| pingdragon| &gt;This is how rape victims are blamed. "She should not have dressed so provocatively". No, the blame is and only is on the one being violent, and no one else. Same goes with speech: if you can't control yourself and react violently then you are the problem, not the one speaking.  So you are saying as long as you dun act violently, you are never wrong? Are you seriously protecting verbally toxic and malicious people? There is literally a law that states that you are partly to blame if you provoke someone into attacking you. EVERYTHING has consequences, that does not exclude freedom of speech or violent people for the matter. Unless you live in a backwards society i dun think anyone dare use the "She should not have dressed so provocatively" argument in this day and age especially in Sg. In fact, as an advocate of free speech, you should support this argument as it not wrong to give your unpopular opinion no matter how fked up it is.   &gt;Losing your freedom to prevent some violent people from being violent is both unfair (why should we lose freedom because of them?) and not worth it. In effect it means the violent people have won - they are imposing their rules and ideas. Let's prevent rape by banning skirts and dresses! Let's prevent religious violence by making offending people illegal!  So you are essentially advocating an Anarchist society? True freedom like Somalia? Their laws are given the middle finger, people kill, rape, steal and plenty of freedom to speak whatever you want, that my friend is the smell of freedom without consequences from big daddy government. Also do you even read what you are typing? You are essentially saying "Violence is okay as long as it is in the name of freedom of speech", that is more violent then "Let's prevent religious violence by making offending people illegal!". You actually wouldn't mind religious violence and that is fked up. You should see a therapist.   &gt;That's not happening because civil people know better than risking going to jail. Amos Yee got it because he basically doesn't care. As this video we started discussing shows, the topic is best avoided in Singapore.  Out of the 7 million people in Sg, no one has done it? Hard to believe, but since you have no evidence, your previous point is completely moot. Keep in mind there is a reason why this vid is from SKM, in other words it is from the government. Interpret however you like but i see that the government is actually doing sth after the whole Amos Yee incident. | 0| 2016-06-29 14:52:35
singapore| bitflag| Once again I'm unsure how natural ressources and size relate to this debate. It doesn't, really. As to multicultural societies, Singapore is very very far from the only one, as this is now the basic model of liberal democracies.   &gt; Also, freedom to offend is the same thing as provoking. Everybody have their limits, no one is gonna take shit from other people indefinitely.  This is how rape victims are blamed. "She should not have dressed so provocatively". No, the blame is and only is on the one being violent, and no one else. Same goes with speech: if you can't control yourself and react violently then you are the problem, not the one speaking.   &gt; Prevention is better than cure  Losing your freedom to prevent some violent people from being violent is both unfair (why should we lose freedom because of them?) and not worth it. In effect it means the violent people have won - they are imposing their rules and ideas. Let's prevent rape by banning skirts and dresses! Let's prevent religious violence by making offending people illegal!   &gt; Also, i need evidence, show me someone in Sg who speak in a civil manner criticizing religion and got arrested for it.  That's not happening because civil people know better than risking going to jail. Amos Yee got it because he basically doesn't care. As this video we started discussing shows, the topic is best avoided in Singapore.| 1| 2016-06-29 14:07:11

OutOfTheLoop| PhillipsD497| Amos Yee is a 17 year old kid from Singapore who is being arrested by the Singapore government for making and sharing YouTube videos critical of Christianity and Islam.

AntiAtheismWatch| Pork_certified| I dont think their all terrible people, but honestly, ive always posted questions at r/atheism because i am skeptical,but they always like to either end their arguments with an insult or something,and when i fact check their arguments, the people who insult are always not the ones who answer properly,and its basically 90% of them.  Recently i asked about a guy called amos yee, he is pretty crazy imho in his videos, and i just asked for plain opinions, but instead i get bombarded with comments attacking theism, where my post in the first place has nothing to do with promoting theism, i was simply asking if his behaviour is considered good,and i was just saying how suprised i was at the approval rating.  And it got so bad that the post had to be removed.  IRL though i live in singapore,the atheists here dont really say much irl, they really dont care. So i never met any bad atheists here in my country.  But i do notice a trend of how they always want to have sex and always love to shitpost about wierd beliefs, maybe to satisfy themselves,totally understandable.. At least they dont openly insult.which is nice| 0| 2016-06-25 18:58:23

Philippines| gust_vo| &gt;Do you have proof that Malays in Singapore don't "embrace their Malay roots?" Because last I checked, Bahasa Melayu is one of the official languages of Singapore and most Malays are free to practice their religion  Yet what the main language they speak is singlish. Also, I'm more highly likely to walk into Filipinos talking to eachother over there in Filipino than hearing two people speaking Malay. Compared to Malaysia which was under the same rule as the British, you can still clearly see a lot of Malay influence in their buildings, art and they export that (in films, artwork). I'm pointing out that you dont see that in Singapore.   &gt;I noticed that in that citation you provided, those countries are first world countries or developed countries. Meanwhile, the Philippines has one of the highest poverty rates in the world  So you're not disproving that there's a large disparity between them.  Also i never said we are rich in a monetary sense, but culturally and in natural resource yes though compared to SG (nice of you to sneak that jab in though).   &gt;I live in a multiracial, multicultural country. Singapore is not the only country with that kind of sentiment. In America, if we have a skin whitening advertisement, there will be anger, especially among the African American population The fact that you don't understand why skin whitening products are racist shows how ignorant you are on the subject  It's in bad taste yes, but it's not racist. I blame this stupid PC bullshit that everything is racist nowadays even if it's a joke, a quip, or just a slip of tongue. Being racist is doing things to undermine a particular race like actively protesting and stopping a peaceful parade, not just saying it. We talked shit a lot a few years ago and you know what, we didnt give a single shit about it too. we knew it was stupid and crap and we disregarded it until someone actively practiced it.  &gt;Face it, you're trying to debunk Singapore's success but it's gonna fail no matter what. Singapore is a role model and it's one of the countries that the Philippines should follow when it comes to economic development. Regarding your comment earlier about Singapore's "freedom of speech." Look, porn is censored in Singapore but prostitution is actually legal there. Why watch porn when you can just do it in real life or you can go to a strip club?  Again, i never said they were not successful economically. I have been impressed by how they leveraged their limited resources into success, But they have been too clinical in attaining that success a sense, it seems like it had negative effects on culture, some fears in the security in work, etc. I dont feel the soul of Singapore in that sense.  As for following in their lead, It's a target to look up to, sure. But it's a different situation IMO. We have a lot more to offer against SG than just land or services: we can leverage our natural resources and manpower (as we have been, just inefficiently), all we need is to open up more to foreign investments (to break monopolies), some government stability and security.   Also, Freedom of Speech means i can shitpost about anything on the internet and not fear of getting arrested (case in point: Amos Yee). And finally Prostitution isnt about freedom of speech, it's more of a rights issue, to work in an industry that is shunned (by religion, which is the main reason it's illegal here in the first place). It's not totally legal in SG though, just made somewhat institutionalized (as with other countries with fully legal prostitution).  (also the porn was a /s but still)  [EDIT] jeez your post was cringeworthy to be honest, it's an example of the PC problem that's destroying America right now... Compare it to our reactions, When you scroll down into the comments, noone's mad at it, most are clearly pointing out why and some are making light-hearted jabs at ourselves for having our stupid biases and the ad itself (especially the woman on the ad who is a gold digger. which it makes it even more funny.) It's just sad that you think that these ads on skin whitening products are racist.| 3| 2016-06-25 06:12:21
HongKong| radishlaw| &gt;If you look at Taiwan, it has just about the most violent politicians and conflicting government in Asia. It's throwing punches instead of bananas. Literally.  That's a bit of outdated information. Taiwan seems to fix up their act a bit nowadays, with Ukraine now the place to watch for "psychical democracy".   &gt; Your claim regarding HK government's stance is speculation, but Singapore is, however, literally a dictatorship, and some might even argue, a dynasty. This is also why Singapore is successful as a city state. Have you heard of Amos Yee?  I think the dictatorial practice by the SG is more of a means than a reason for success.   A better track to argue against using Singapore as an example, is that it was expelled from the Federation of Malaysia, which would be unthinkable for Hong Kong. And one should note that the agreement, set in the year Singapore went independent and is set to expire soon, is a source of [problems between the two countries](http://www.academia.edu/6206467/The_Water_Issue_Between_Singapore_and_Malaysia_No_Solution_in_Sight).   &gt;[Taiwan's situation]  I think two things caused the lost of support of Taiwan - Cheng withdrawing the ROC from UN, and United State's "pivot" to PRC after its falling out with the USSR.  It is literally a unrepeatable situation and really can't prove or disprove Hong Kong's ability in independence.  | 4| 2016-06-24 18:18:30
Philippines| gust_vo| The thing that SG has up on us is the Government is well run.  We still have our native heritage (and we're damn proud of it), the disparity between rich and poor is being tackled by the government, and our racial/ethnic tensions is concentrated in the south and because of fringe elements and primarily because of some Muslim separatists (Compare that to the chinese-malay-indian and we'll include PH/foreign workers in SG having issues with one another. good thing we're all not stuck in one island). Also the Amos Yee bullshit happening over there wont be a big deal over here.  If it sounds familiar to you, you might not be living in the PH (or you need to get out more).| 2| 2016-06-24 16:36:00
HongKong| upperwater| &gt;There wouldn't be conflicts in a government that was independent.  &gt;If you look at Taiwan  If you look at Taiwan, it has just about the most violent politicians and conflicting government in Asia. It's throwing punches instead of bananas. Literally.  &gt;Singapore faced the same challenges when it became independent.  Your claim regarding HK government's stance is speculation, but Singapore is, however, literally a dictatorship, and some might even argue, a dynasty. This is also why Singapore is successful as a city state. Have you heard of Amos Yee?   I find it very strange that people compare the possibility of independence with the successes of Taiwan and Singapore. Taiwan was also a dictatorship for a very long time. In fact, it was under martial law for the longest time of almost 4 decades. Is it successful? University graduates graduating in recent years have been making less than those who graduate a decade ago. The newly elected president hadn't dared to provoke the CCP because it damn well knows they need that financial opportunity open for them. Only 21 UN member states recognize the ROC. I don't see what you mean by Beijing trying to prevent Taiwan from gaining further independence. Do you not agree that Taiwan is completely sovereign and free already? China's one China Policy is successful, and it's only successful because it is internationally supported.  I'd actually love to hear the educated arguments of people who support HK independence. | 9| 2016-06-24 15:32:53

Mostly nothing but praise here.  &gt;Guaranteed, generous pensions  Again, who wants this?  &gt;No conscription  Will certainly free up a lot of money in the budget.  &gt; Low tax rates  Yeah no, Singapore has a disgustingly low tax rate (especially for the top bracket).  &gt; High levels of public safety  What does this have to do with any of the points above? Do you think we need conscription to have enough policemen or something? Or that people will start robbing banks if there is freedom of speech?  &gt;Income mobility Again what does fighting income inequality have to do with income mobility?  &gt;Cheap and efficient public services  Err, ok.  &gt;Cultural diversity &gt;Social and political stability  Pretty much every first world country these days has a lot of diversity. Some more so than us. You don't see riots in their streets caused by free speech do you? | 1| 2016-06-22 07:31:44

AskReddit| Tusjecht| Amos Yee was very brave and very insensitive to have made the video to begin with. While I will applaud him for being able to articulate his thoughts about the issues he believed in, he picked a very bad time to do it, when national sentiments were at an all-time high and more often than not people would defend Ex-PM Lee on the basis that he was a founding father that had just passed away. Making tasteless sexual jokes with the Ex-PM did not make it any better. Amos Yee took what little freedom of speech he had and dug himself a grave for want of a little attention.  Well, all this is besides the issue, but I felt that some context should be required to understand why he was arrested to begin with.| 8| 2016-06-21 10:13:06

This video in particular has gotten him in trouble with the authorities for BS hate speech codes in Singapore, and has gotten him death threats from muslims around the world:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXZfR7iUTgQ  As you can see his video is just as absurd as OP's, but it includes the maker's identity and location. Amos Yee has A LOT to worry about because he criticized islam and did not do so anonymously. He is being prosecuted by the state for this and receives constant death threats.

This is after all going to have long-term effects on society and country.   A good first step: define 'foreign'. Does a company need to be registered in Singapore to be considered 'non-foreign', if not how to define it.  And what the heck does 'support in the public sphere' mean? Financial support? Making a public statement on state media? Company wide email? Or even someone from the company posting a video on Youtube aka Amos Yee? Only if it goes viral, I guess.   Second step: Define 'social issues'. Does it include 'democracy', 'freedom of speech', 'protecting muh offended feelingz'| 9| 2016-06-20 14:39:44
malaysia| DerpyNerdy| It's the Internet.  There are many annoying comments and they don't just come from these PRC loving Chinese Malaysians.  Maybe they feel some misplaced sense of patriotism when someone speaks ill of their 'motherland'.  Maybe they don't feel like they belong to Malaysia and would easily consider China as the superior country.  There could be a lot of reasons,  but ultimately it would just lead back to the fact that not everyone feels proud about their country, and not just Malaysians.    We have names like Amos Yee who we all know is super critical of Singapore.  Ai Weiwei is one of those mainland Chinese who is also critical of the Chinese government.  My point is, everyone has their own way of thinking and no one thinks like the other.     | 5| 2016-06-20 14:08:44

singapore| reize| Because it is exactly that. 10 years ago as a young undergraduate I felt exactly like people like Amos Yee, I had a lot of things to say about the system, everything is bad about the country (although i didn't really go as far as ranting in other people's faces like he did though).  Cue a decade later after starting work and travelling a whole lot more. You get an entire world and their cultures as a yardstick to compare Singapore to and you realize shit could have been a lot more worse, when I used to dream of moving to the US before.  Now I've pretty mellowed and done a 360 on most of my immature views from 10 years ago. Except weather. Weather never changes, it still sucks.| 48| 2016-06-19 12:27:19

singapore| ayam| Not attention, but an exchange of ideas. Alas, there are too few conversations where people are truly accepting of alternative views. Most cling on to what they believe and everything else must be wrong.   Navy seal guy gets disparaged all the time, because he too, clings on to his belief that he was innocent. While I can sympathise with his need to maintain his innocence, too many factors just don't add up to fit his version of events. That insistence undermines everything he says. And you can't say he wasn't seeking attention, he was posting his story to various subreddits in the hope of garnering support. On Amos Yee though, I felt he's more harshly treated on this subreddit. I don't agree with his opinions but I feel he shouldn't be persecuted for it. He posts videos on his own youtube channel that no one is compelled to see, it's not like he is shouting it out on the streets. I see it as a young man saying angry stuff (not violent stuff), why the need to expend state resources to monitor him?| 3| 2016-06-16 20:26:21
singapore| lee_guan_you| &gt; It's a state of mind. Perhaps also a reflection that maybe people these days have thinner skins.  it goes beyond that. All of us who post comments here are doing so because we desire attention for our opinions. If faced with a constant barrage of downvotes for simply voicing one's opinion, seeking dialogue in this place will ultimately seem futile. Gradually, one is discouraged from commenting because it ultimately feels like teaching a cow to appreciate music.   Case in point: That navy seal whom people here love to pick on even when he is not present. Although he may be slightly deranged, I've witnessed several of his more logical and reasonable opinions get buried under a flurry of downvotes because of his username (which hilariously defeats the purpose of a throwaway), and that just kills discussion. another slightly off topic about this ironic fella, he is singled out as some sort of subreddit bogeyman all the time while simultaneously derided for being "attention seeking" by hypocrites who love picking on him. Not even Amos yee reached such levels of meme magic on /r/singapore.| 8| 2016-06-16 20:03:24

They know what they're doing.  &gt;You think the years of turmoil in their region left them unscathed, and that none of their behavior is consistent with PTSD and co-morbid mental illnesses?  Absolutely. Make no mistake - ISIS is about Islam taking its conquering nature seriously. ISIS is pretty much the inevitable outcome of Islam.

exmuslim| winter32842| Amos Yee is not that knowledgeable about Islam. I saw Amos Yee debate with Adam Saleh. Adam Saleh just ran the typical Islamic talking points and made a lot  false claims, Amos could not counter or correct any of them. We need someone in the spotlight representing us (the anti-Islam crowd) who is knowledgeable and able to counter the arguments, so Muslims watching the debates can be convinced of their falsehood and question Islam. | 3| 2016-06-16 08:55:18
exmuslim| [deleted]| I wish an ex-Muslim would make videos similar to Amos Yee bashing Islam in the same 'edgy' way. That way a Muslim couldn't say "you just skipped the GOOD PARTS!" Also, that painting symbolism should've backfired on Adam in many ways.

KotakuInAction| Boltarrow5| &gt; Yeah. All those trans people Nat was responding to were fucking idiots.  Let me use this one trans person as a stepping stone to prop my argument on!  &gt;I don't believe I've seen a single person do that.  I wish I had a reaction image for that, that is so fucking preposterous its incredible.  &gt;What the fuck are you even talking about? People who wish to discriminate against and attack the innocent will do so. They don't need it to be made any "easier" because there is already such a low barrier to entry. It's not like that problem can be made any worse. In the mean time, let's not ignore the fact, the fact, the fact, how many times do I have to say that, that the Koran mandates the murder of heretics, apostates, unbelievers, and gay people? Like Amos Yee said, moderate Muslims that don't kill people, are underachievers.  Are you fucking dumb? The more a populace dislikes another populace, the easier it is to treat them worse at a societal level. See *all of human history* for reference.  &gt;Like Amos Yee said, moderate Muslims that don't kill people, are underachievers.  How childish.  &gt;Wrong again. I would go so far as to say NO Muslim is the enemy. The enemy is the ideology of theocratic Islam. It is Islam and the way it is practiced, yes, even by most "moderates" in the larger portion of the world that needs fixing. I'd say they need a Martin Luther-style reformation, but that still left Christianity with a lot of problems.  Well then it gets tiring to see people use Islam as a mechanism to harm Muslims, to justify dumb shit like discrimination by religion. You're right on one thing, Islam as a religion can be used to harm. But freedom of religion is paramount, period. If they want to practice it and not harm people then they can to their hearts content. It will take time for Islam to be brought into the modern world considering the majority Muslim countries have been decimated by war. Then it will become as benign as any other religion.| 1| 2016-06-15 16:46:56

I don't believe I've seen a single person do that.  &gt; I dont like the religion but most people who follow it are on some level compatible with civilization as a whole.  Depends on the religion, and what version of the particular religion, you're talking about. It also depends on what civilization you're talking about.  &gt; When you generalize and put over a billion people into the group of radicals who are harming us you make it easier to discriminate against innocent people.  What the fuck are you even talking about? People who wish to discriminate against and attack the innocent will do so. They don't need it to be made any "easier" because there is already such a low barrier to entry. It's not like that problem can be made any worse.

SquaredCircle| Emperor-Nero| Okay let me dumb it down. The laws are vague that is what I am talking about. Also you lack understanding of speech. Not surprising for a young one . Hate Speech is protected speech, because sooner rather than later any speech that critiques ideas that are not okay to speak out against. All ideas deserve to be criticized, but you'll ignore shit like Amos Yee who is on trial for "offending" people. That is your future.  Yes, I am so bigoted you got me there with your strawman. Also yes not mainstream relevance that is why we are seeing college students losing their shit at the thought of different ideas, that honestly aren't even bad. Moderates who dare step out of their little box get labeled as things they aren't. That is why on top of that we see people who are supporting Donald Trump being attacked and shut down, because the man says "mean" things. I am a libertarian, and believe all speech as long as violence is not incited than it's okay.  Well I am sorry that you think they aren't. It is people like you that can't see the forest through the trees. And have no idea what is happening you're living in your bubble. I am not listening to any right wing radio it's clear as fucking day. That people are willing to give away their rights as a form of security.

OutOfTheLoop| tacocatz92| it's referring to Amos Yee ...the kid from Singapore..a year ago he said something about the ex-prime minister of Singapore when he died and compared him something like to jesus in a negative way..recently he was sentenced for it because of Singapore law, and now people want him free because of human rights.  there is more backstory to him and what happen during his trials like he got slapped by someone furious with him for making the comments about the prime minister, and how he accused someone of molesting him then said it was just something to rattle the media...  i'm not familiar with the story as i stopped following them few months ago and only stumbled upon his story from time to time...and back in 2015 that kid seems like a troll-baiting for the media to rage , don't really know about him now..i hope someone can explain it better and correct me if there is something wrong | 3| 2016-06-13 22:36:54
singapore| ExynosInfinite| I'll just paste this from my Facebook status:  &gt; When you have a law like 377A that oppresses gay people and that it's "supported" by the government, people like Bryan Lim are going to make use of that, claim his part as a law-abiding Singaporean citizen/NS man/etc. to be malicious toward the LGBT community.  &gt; So long the government doesn't take a stand and repeal 377A, it can never be even neutral in such situations.   &gt; It's even more than equal rights now, it's about protection and respect. Just like how Singapore lost their shit over Amos Yee and his malicious statements, every other aspect of humanity must be protected by the law as well.| 20| 2016-06-13 21:13:53

The_Donald| LongDistanceEjcltr| This kid is a fucking hero, subscribe to him here: https://www.youtube.com/user/BrainAndButter  &gt; Adam Saleh, perhaps the biggest dickhead and dunce on YouTube, has called Amos Yee racist for mocking Islam, and sent his 1.1 million subscribers to report Amos's video in an attempt to silence him. The video has now been swarmed with Muslims issuing threats, calls for the video to be taken down, and claims to have reported it. You may recall that Amos Yee will probably serve between 18 months and 3 years in prison for mocking Islam and Christianity on YouTube and other social media. Adam Saleh's new affront to free speech will not stand. This is the UNCENSORED version of Amos's video which does not currently exist on his channel. MIRROR IT EVERYWHERE. THUMB UP AMOS YEE'S VIDEO. THUMB DOWN ADAM SALEH'S VIDEO. Adam Saleh and his followers can suck the free world's balls.| 2| 2016-06-13 18:05:27

Anyway the game is decently easy once u rank up your heroes and ISO them correctly.. but yeah I think the reward system in this game is a bit lackluster at the moment. There are task rewards but there aren't like any 'real achievements' like 'alpha tester' or something like that that can give your team an extra bonus in combat.. say 10% to health?

singapore| ColeWalski| 'Amos Yee was right'. You really like this rhetoric, do you not? Well let me just point out that his analysis of the Koran was literally surface value off the cuff reading with no attempt at deeper analysis, weighing with the other parts of the text as a whole, nor with any research or historical background. Even one quick google can find good counterarguments to all this. In general that applies to most of the atuff he spews anyway.  No one is saying any of this is right, or trying to justify slavery as correct. Even the video itself doesn't try to deny that slavery happened, his counter is that Amos is again, trying to apply the context of US slavery in the 1800s to pre medieval practices.   You seem to know a lot about Islamic practices and history, why not do some research yourself for the answers as well as about Jesus? The Islamic faith also has respect for Jesus but as a prophet rather than the Son of God, so lets not go into comparing religions.  And finally, I seem to see you on this sub a lot, and *only* this sub. So while we're at it, in a post I for once have some degree of control over as the poster:  Why hang around so much when from analysis of your previous controversial comments you utterly hate Singapore and think we're all horrible people? Is it to hopefully spread more anger and hatred directed at this nation? To show to foreigners how horrible really life is here in your opinion? To just annoy people because it gives you kicks? Seeking others who share your opinion? Because appare tly there aren't many. Look at your karma and the comments you make that contribute absolutely nothing to discussions. Do you not have other subs to hang out on, other things to read or create? Wouldn't it be nice to have some upvotes and gold for once?   And also, for God's sake, use capitalisations at the start of your sentences, you make yourself look ridiculous without them.| -10| 2016-06-13 16:28:50
singapore| YourHeartIsTheKey| &gt; I'm no Islamic scholar, but from what I do know, the Arab slavery situation existed long before Islam was a thing. Hence in context of that time period having slaves was pefectly normal, and the Koran advocated for them to be treated well even though they were slaves.  of course and the Qu'ran evolved and accommodated to these pre-Islamic Arabic slave practices. sexual slavery was not disallowed. neither was castration of male slaves. it was common place in the Arab slave trade even after the tribes had been united under Islam.   also wars into Africa, Persia and India were not waged in self defence. the came to conquer and take black slaves. this is what the Umar, 2nd caliph and friend of Muhammad did.  in fact he himself was killed by a Persian slave when he refused to grant him freedom.   &gt; And it doesn't mean Muslims today follow this, they recognise that was then and this is now, same as how modern Christians and Jews don't follow the archaic stuff in the earlier parts of the Bible anymore. I am assuming even now you're thinking up a sacarstic smart alecky countereply explaining how I am completely wrong and a brainwashed sheep and how Amos Yee was right all along. Guess what, I'm not writing this for your benefit because I know you wouldn't listen, I'm doing so for any other people with similar misconceptions about religion who might wander across this thread and maybe might just listen.  well Amos Yee was actually right.. slavery (sexual slavery also) was permitted in Sharia Law, and in the Qu'ran and the biographies of Muhammad, who was himself a slave owner and trader.  AFAIK, Jesus was not a slave owner or a slave trader. isn't that a big difference? (no i am not a christian)    | 8| 2016-06-13 16:15:56
singapore| soupbuns| If they can write a letter to MDA about 2 men having a quick peck on a theater stage and have action taken, or if people can write a letter to complain about Amos Yee for hurting their sensibilities, then I'm all for having this guy being reported to the police.

singapore| YourHeartIsTheKey| regardless, the Qu'ran and the hadith and the biography of Muhammad (Life of muhammad) by ibn ishaq are by themselves an anti-islamic argument, lol.  Amos yee isn't necessarily the most qualified guy to interpret this but a lot of what he alludes to and worse is definitely there. don't believe it? pick up a qu'ran and read for yourself.  the fact that every small verse has paragraphs dedicated to qualify and apologise for the violence and intolerance is a dead give away. | 0| 2016-06-13 15:38:37
singapore| ColeWalski| Ironically, thse people themselves do in fact think they are being persecuted. To them, their society of nice normal heterosexual people is being threatened by these wild homosexual deviants with their western liberal values, and for the more religious ones, the coming of sin and promotion of wrongdoing.  Of course, its a damned stupid mindset to have because at this point in time the LGBT community isn't really demanding for anything outside acceptance, but its probably some very deeply entrenched values in a large group of people.  Amos Yee on the other hand is promoting the opposite, more liberal way of extreme thinking that denounces all religion as bad and the governemnt as bad and everyone as bad except himself. However as its just one guy in this case it is far easier for him to be dealt with as compared to a large group or an idealogy.| 0| 2016-06-13 15:11:05

KotakuInAction| ARealLibertarian| &gt; ? Can you prove to me that A) tension increases over time B) said tension leads to physical violence if not released   Can you name a society that doesn't have tension? And it takes a long time before there's political/religious/ethnic groups attacking each other.  &gt; C) ranting about religion on the internet like Amos Yee decreases said tension D) banning Amos Yee-style rants will cause increased tension and eventually physical violence?  Simply because he provides a unifying figure in the sense everyone can agree that whatever their differences he's an asshole.  And it's not that far between banning Amos Yee-style rants and banning all but the most tepid &amp; toothless criticism of religion.  &gt; Those are some astounding claims I see repeated by liberals and libertarians all over the internet but no proof.  Notice how Sweden &amp; Germany have some of the strictest "anti-hate speech" laws? Notice how they're the worst hit among the European nations during the migrant crisis?  On the other notice how Britain is one of the few European nations that doesn't have laws against holocaust denial? Notice how [David Irving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Irving) was gaining a massive following until Britain put his ass down by *not tossing his ass in jail* for saying offensive things but instead allowing him to sue people for calling him a holocaust denier and then having his credibility torn apart in court?  It's not iron-clad proof, but it is a tendency that keeps showing up.  &gt; Dissidents can openly rant on the internet whenever they want to. It's legal and people do it all the time. You just can't do it in a manner which local laws deem harmful, like what Amos Yee did. If he stopped at "PM Lee is an idiot", which he has said in some form or another and not been charged for, nothing would have happened.  Again, you want the knee-jerk malcontents of a society to be as stupid &amp; alienating as possible. Put the Amos Yees in jail and the next generational of shit-stirrers is going to be smarter &amp; more persuasive.  Just like when Europe put the "Gas the Kikes! *Race War Now!!!*" tards in prison it made David Irving far more persuasive.  &gt; And America has survived civil and international wars, and numerous cases of nationwide unrest. Both systems survived many challenges and both worked for a long time, but I don't see that as proof that either is the best form of governance for everyone all the time.  Rome/Byzantium didn't survive as "systems", they had kings, a republic, and a empire and there was massive systematic change even in the 500 years between Augustus I &amp; Romulus Augustus.  When comparing Rome to America protests in America turned into riots in Rome, riots in America turned into revolts in Rome, revolts in America turned into civil wars in Rome, and civil wars in America turned into decades of anarchy &amp; near-total collapse in Rome.  &gt; How well has Iraqi or Afghani democracy worked over the last few years?  Establishing democracy has to either go slow, or not be done on the watch of corrupt authoritarians. Remember that the Iraqi "democracy" wasn't allowed to overturn the occupational authorities directives including the "sell off all state assets not nailed down at fire sale prices".  That level of economic chaos was never going to end well.  &gt; That's a non-argument that can be used to define anything and everything.  It simply means "just because you're doing fine, don't assume everyone else is, and if other people have problems they make can you share those problems".  &gt; I will, thank you for the discussion.  Thank you as well, it's nice to have a discussion.| 2| 2016-05-30 06:11:38
KotakuInAction| MagosBiologis| &gt; How about kitchen knives? Or gasoline/paint thinner?  Yes, still possible.  &gt; On a societal level being capable of releasing tension in a peaceful manner makes it much less likely that tension will be released in a violent manner.  Empirical proof for your claims? Can you prove to me that A) tension increases over time B) said tension leads to physical violence if not released C) ranting about religion on the internet like Amos Yee decreases said tension D) banning Amos Yee-style rants will cause increased tension and eventually physical violence? Those are some astounding claims I see repeated by liberals and libertarians all over the internet but no proof.  &gt; It's why letting dissidents openly air their grievances works better, they get less angry feeling that they're being listened to, if they're a bunch of psychos they lose popular support, and if they're going to start a revolution then you know who they are and where they live.  Dissidents can openly rant on the internet whenever they want to. It's legal and people do it all the time. You just can't do it in a manner which local laws deem harmful, like what Amos Yee did. If he stopped at "PM Lee is an idiot", which he has said in some form or another and not been charged for, nothing would have happened.  &gt; Given that Byzantium was basically a continuation of Rome it lasted well over 2000 years, but those years were not commonly peaceful &amp; rarely without some form of crisis as it changes borders, capitals, forms of government, and religions. The Crisis of the Third Century was enough chaos for 500 years all by itself.  And America has survived civil and international wars, and numerous cases of nationwide unrest. Both systems survived many challenges and both worked for a long time, but I don't see that as proof that either is the best form of governance for everyone all the time.  &gt;If not America, how about Canada or the UK? And your life might not be improved, but others may. And when other people you have to live with are unhappy they tend to spread it around.  Others may, and others may have their lives get worse. Proof that their lives will definitely improve, or at least that the pros outweigh the cons? How well has Iraqi or Afghani democracy worked over the last few years?  &gt; Marie Antoinette's life was pretty good up until it all went wrong for example.  That's a non-argument that can be used to define anything and everything.  &gt; But the problem is that free speech has a long track record of being both easier to spend then thought and more important then believed. Historically a nation imposing restrictions on free speech is going downhill, while a nation broadening protection of free speech is on the upswing.  &gt;That's something to consider.

atheism| Darth_Sin| No I am not. I simply do not want government to shield and protect nonsense and stupidity from criticism and mockery.   If someone believed that the Earth revolved around the sun or that the Earth is flat, people would mock them and criticize them and the government would not step it and should not step in. If people believed that vaccines cause autism, they would be mocked and criticized and the government won't step in with censorship laws.  So why is it that we need to make exceptions and excuses for the idea of God and God's tenets ? Why should the government protect these two ideas with censorship laws while letting ideas such as geocentrism, flat earth theory, creationism, vaccines causing autism, etc be perfectly open to criticism and mockery ?  That is something you seem to be incapable of understanding. I simply do not want religion, which is a set of ideas, be protected from criticism and mockery by the government via censorship laws. Additionally, ethnicity and religions are not equivalent in any way. You cannot change your ethnic group but you can change your religion or more sensibly, you can renounce your religion. One is fixed while the other isn't. You are making a false equivalency.   I am for the equal treatment of everyone. I am for the open exchange and criticism and mockery of ideas by everyone. It is you and the Singapore government that have decided that religion is a "legitimate" belief that needs to be protected by censorship laws.   Moreover, did I ever advocate for the segregation and oppression of the religious ? No. Did I advocate for the treatment of the religious as second class dhimmi citizens who must be forced to pay a jizya tax ? No. Did I advocate for some form of Atheist Inquisition or Atheist Witch Hunt whereby atheists go and hunt for religious people, torture them and kill them in horrific ways ? No. All I am saying is that people, especially the government of a nation and a secular nation at that, should not protect religion from mockery and criticism, especially given that the government does not protect people who believe in palmistry, alchemy, astrology, geocentrism, flat earth, creationism, vaccines causes autism, global warming is a hoax from criticism and mockery.   Last but not the least, do not presume to know me. I am for the criticism and mockery of primitive superstitious nonsense on all levels, and that includes Muslims practicing jihad or Christians blowing up abortion clinics.    What threat did Amos Yee posed ? Had he waged jihad ? No. Did we plan to suicide bomb himself ? No. Did he push for oppressive laws like Hudud or Shariah ? No. Did he blow up an abortion clinic ? No. Did he force young impressionable children to emotional and mental abuse by teaching them if they did not believe in god that they would burn and be tortured in hell ? No. All Amos Yee did was say mean but perfectly true things about religion. For that he was arrested. Boo-fucking-hoo. Cry me a freaking river. Heck, if you look at how Amos Yee was received by the public, someone, most likely religious tried to assault him for saying a few mean but true things. Isn't it ironic that all atheists want is the freedom to criticize and mock religion but the religious will enact actual real world violence that causes massive property damage and tremendous loss of life ? Isn't is even ironic that we have people that think that governments protecting religions is a good thing ?   Finally, how do you think many of the religions in the world today came to be tolerant or accepting of others or be non-violent ? Because we had governments protecting them by enacting censorship laws ? No, its because religion was criticized and mocked, even by other religious people that ultimately resulted in religion having to evolve to be more non-violent. Giving religion protection and censoring criticism and mockery of religious is not progressive, but it is regressive. There is also the fact that respect is earned, not given. You don't just give religions respect. It is the people like you with the mentality that religion needs to be "respected" and protected from criticism and mockery who are no different than the Christians who heaped so much shit on Galileo. If people like you were the norm during the time Charles Darwin published his works on evolution, the government would have banned evolution because it was "offensive" to religion. Its people with your mentality that religion needs to be protected forced many scientists like Copernicus to go underground because of his findings and research. The notion of protecting religion out some sense of respect via censorship laws instead of allowing it to be exposed to criticism and mockery is not only highly insidious, but also damaging to human progress. | 4| 2016-05-29 14:02:14

KotakuInAction| MagosBiologis| It works at enforcing harmony, and I support him being jailed because he's intentionally breaking the law.  Some background: if you're Muslim and say you want to kill Christians/apostates/whatever, you'll also be jailed. If you're an evangelical Christian and distribute Chick Tracts, you'll also be jailed. These examples have literally happened in the past. The law applies to everyone.  Singapore has faced near-annihilation from racial and religious strife, and the needs of the many outweigh the needs of Amos Yee. If some brutality is necessary so be it. If he wants to die on this hill then let him.  And if anyone here is foolish enough to think that our government can be externally pressured into leniency, well, one prime minister (Lee Kuan Yew) went public and denounced the CIA in international news when they tried to bribe him, and for the Michael Fay incident, not even Bill Clinton could stop Michael Fay from his getting his ass flayed with a cane.| -17| 2016-05-28 21:09:47

singapore| reize| I thine /u/OnePunchCat is refering to if they changed the Presidential selection process to one where Parliament gets to nominate the candidates before election starts, he'd vote to put Amos Yee into Parliament so that the rest of Parliament doesn't (by virtue of being mostly from the same party, PAP) pick only political Yes-Mans (PAP biased Presidents) for people to vote on.  The suggestion is stupid, but it does raise a good point that if this change happened, the people will suffer unless the composition of Parliament also changes so not all of them are from the same party.| 6| 2016-05-19 10:07:04

singapore| neraknerak| Singapore is a police-state and really boring, unless you like shopping in malls, man-made very artificial looking parks and amusement parks. It has very little free speech. On the positive side, it is really safe and has very little (violent/bodily) crime. Basically I mean robbery/battery in public, etc. There is teenage rape and molestation or outrage of modesty. I'm sure there's white collar crime. You can walk around really late at night and feel 99.5% sure nothing seriously bad is going to happen to you whereas in LA, NYC, Paris, I would only feel about 75% sure in a good neighborhood. The weather of course. People do not speak proper English; they speak Singlish. And they take the British spin on things (lift, queue, etc). People do not like to chat but they do love complaining. I found the people nice but because it is not a fun place, stressed out and up-tight. It is a good place to work and get/save money if you are in the higher income bracket. You get used to it. I guess it's good if you have a family. If you really see how people live, in their HDB flats, it is not very nice compared to USA for example. They have mismatched furniture, plastic doors, small crappy appliances. They still have bathrooms with a wet bath arrangement, meaning the shower just splashes all over the bathroom into a drain hole in the floor, usually the toilet and sink is in a separate room. A car is super expensive (3x or more the price in USA due to taxes) and you can only keep it maximum 10 years. After that, the government FORCES you to scrap it, even if it's a perfectly good car. I'm not really sure they scrap it or sell it to another country abroad. Cars not affordable except for the top earners. Public transportation, the MRT is really good and the city is pretty walkable. The food is gross, overcooked vegetables, etc. Their idea of 'Western' food is really disgusting and poorly executed. Organic food is almost non-existent. They have these Chinese brands that are supposedly organic XinXin? but are definitely not because it tastes like shit and the organic label is not regulated there. You pay $12 SGD for a small punnet of non-organic berries, $14 for some Greek yogurt like Fage, and $6 for Jiff Peanut Butter. The coffee there is terrible! Terrible! At hawker centers or starbucks, the coffee is just burned, acidic and gross. Milk! Most of the milk there is UHT milk. If you have never tasted UHT milk, it does not taste like fresh milk or milk they sell in USA. It has a weird buttery chemical taste to it. You can buy fresh milk imported from Australia but its a bit expensive. They do not use hot water to wash dishes at most regular places to eat out. They do not normally have hot water set up in the kitchen sink in your flat/apartment. They use external water heater units in the bathroom. There are huge rats at some of the 'hawker' food centers; I saw a rat the size of a fat cat, the largest of my life in Singapore. They make good brochures and websites and fancy buildings but it is definitely not as clean/pristine as they say. The bathrooms are dirty, men pick their nose, they put plastic plates in a plastic bin at hawker centres and drag them across the floor where they handwash with tepid water. They have prostitution, massage parlors, etc. No riots though except 1 like a year ago and 1 in the 70s. They look down upon foreign workers and there is unspoken racism between Singaporean Chinese, Malay, Indians, foreign workers and Ang Mo. Also being gay is not talked about there. I think it's illegal. There are lots of gay people but they pretty much pretend at work and in public that they're not. If you happen to be gay male, join a gym, they are all there. PDA is pretty much not allowed (as in most Asian countries). I think I saw 3 couples kiss in public in all the years that I was there (probably foreigners or drunk). If you make a lot of money ($200,000 SGD and up), then you could probably afford a condo and a car. But barely. There is CCTV everywhere you go. There is NO privacy in Singapore except perhaps locked in your flat/apartment. And I'm sure the government monitors your handphone, your laptop and would crack down if you started to say some negative shit about the government, WAY more earlier than in America. Just read about this teenage kid who said some goofy shit named Amos Yee. And LASTLY, reddit is blocked in Singapore so I don't think you can even read this there. | 1| 2016-05-10 12:58:21

Brunei| sec5| To be balanced when you say that Singapore is known for suppression and censorship when compared to the west, you must also compare Brunei to it.  Brunei has no democratic citizen representative system, texts criticizing Royalty carry a prison/death sentence (by law, Lèse-majesté), Films are outright banned or censored regardless of political nature, the media is far more censored and restricted than Singapore. There is actually a vibrant and healthy debate-argument culture going on in Singapore media and in forums, just that some topics are abit more sensitive. When Amos Yee said fuck LKY on LKY's _funeral_, he was made to appear in court and given a slap on the wrist. In Brunei, try be a citizen and releasing an equivalent video in an equally sensitive situation. We dont need to guess what will happen. So that said there is a limit to how open minded in expression we should be, especially for Asian societies.  By and large, Singapores suppression of journalism and political censorship, is a western invention put in to put down a rising Asian country. You see the same type of libelous commentary about China right now, from the western media. And on Japan when it was undergoing its economic transformation in the 60s/70s. You must understand that there is an agenda behind the scenes and while the world in general operates on egalitarian ideology on surface, it actually operates on geo- realpolitiks in essence.  That said I also want to contrast that with what I initially meant and am trying to push when I posted John Cleese's video. What he is against, is being so sensitive that you then seek out to control and impose a blanket muzzle ban on critical topics and subjects - which _is_ the case in Brunei. That people have intellectual constitutions so fragile that they need to have laws or a social atmosphere put into restrict what they see and hear. People should have the right to be offended, and then also have the right to speak out about what they feel is right or wrong about the situation - in a critical academic environment, this leads to constructive discussion and growth in a community.  In a high level minister meeting that I once attended, they started off with a few Doas, followed by alot of Kata Kata Haluans, Every sentence was almost 50% fillers and words like 'If I may, If it pleases' or titles, or 'Yang atu Yang ani'. Almost 50% of every sentence was unnecessary formal jargon. The conversations were so low key that nothing of value was actually exchanged and it was to me more like a series of face giving by each party followed by a prayer or a food break. It is a ceremony. You can see this in almost every public interaction in this country from the LegCo meetings to the RTB presenters, its all scripted and no true transaction takes place. If you attend any meeting, you'd know this is true, and if you know even more, you'd know that things are already decided beforehand behind the scenes.  There is a term for this, its called being fatuous. If you read Chinese classics like i was mentioning to another user, they mention that when the ruler is indetermined, then his administration and staffers will turn fatuous, concerned with polite commentary above reason and sense, this leads to corruption and eventual collapse, and the classic then continues to note with a list of dynasties and rulers, who succumbed to that fate.   This is what is happening to Brunei, and you can see the trickle down effect here on r/Brunei. People recoil in mock surprise and horror when their views are challenged and not given due consideration, and the decorum of being polite is broken -- as if a stupid idea is worth consideration (and worst, affirmation) simply because hes have a right to express it. This is the general reaction when you tell people are wrong and you tell people why. The whole idea of intellectual academia is to discuss and vet ideas, and also critically shoot them down if they are nonsensical and irrelevant - this is lost here on r/Brunei, alot of people here confuse a right to expresion as a right to validate their ideas, that they should be immune to lashback. No it isnt. Maybe in a Bruneian school under the gentle care of your teacher it would be, even up to UBD, but out in society, you shouldnt be surprised if someone better informed comes at you and calls you and challenges you for it - rather than cry wolf and throw a label at them and play victim - i've seen this so many times here interacting with people, including ones who I consider are intelligent and knowledgable. There is a very low ability to think critically and accept use criticism to adjust and improve their own worldview in r/Brunei and in general, the country.  In short you can say that Bruneians are so shy of adversity and confrontation that its doing them harm. Scale it up and this is whats happening to the country, and has been happening for over 30 years already. Bruneians arent uneducated, or unknowledgable. We score the highest markers on quality of life, literacy, standard of living etc. Its just that they are not courageous enough to take up a cause, and open themselves up to the kind of risk, rigor and structure needed for constructive dialogue and continuous improvement. Its a poisonous outdated mentality that needs to change.   If you need me to paint a picture, you can imagine everyone on a pedestal with a huge ability to observe and a huge speaking voice, all professing their observations and commentaries, but none having the ability to listen, truly consider, discuss, exchange, and promulgate anything more. Again this reflects the state of Brunei, both at a smaller and at a larger level. In the end all you have, is incoherent noise. An over-investment in religion and a lack of separation between state and religion, and between individual religion and society at large, is also a large cause of this.  To be honest, I'am abit angry that Brunei has so much going on for them, that people are educated, and knowledgable, but the country continues to be stuck and mired in mediocrity. We should have been Dubai of the East a decade ago ...  Since you mentioned. I'd also say that American styled political correctness, is another story altogether, and are born out of a different set of conditions and issues that are by far and large irrelevant to the topic at hand and so I wont touch on that. American politics is so far polarized and popularized, that even most voting Americans believe is a farce. Though I would say that I believe politically, economically, there is actually far LESS freedom in the US than it would say Malaysia or Indonesia. The image America tries to sell to the world is not really what they themselves practice.| 1| 2016-05-04 12:53:39

singapore| [deleted]| tl;dw:  Don't vote for CSJ because he's a "power-hungry piece of shit like every other politician". He may be better than Murali, but voters should vote strategically to get the infrastructure they want. He cited Potong Pasir as an example. The opposition held it for 20 years and was unable to construct new infrastructure, but once PAP took it in 2010 they built new facilities. This led to the biggest vote swing in 2015 GE. Thus, Bukit Batok SMC residents should do the same.  Yee also went to criticize CSJ's stump speech, especially \#TheTimeIsNow. He says there's no urgency in getting CSJ into parliament, as one opposition MP among 80 PAP MPs will have no effect, as WP has proved. If CSJ really wants to speak out for the common man, instead of speaking in a censored parliament, he should do so on the internet like Amos Yee.  Additionally, Amos Yes believes that the opposition should only contest when there's a chance they can win a majority or supermajority of the parliament seats, since that's the only way they can implement their 'better' foreign policies and economic plans. In the meantime, Singaporeans should continue voting for PAP to get the infrastructure they want.| 23| 2016-05-03 07:18:37

Futurology| krr33x8| I think a lot of people who have never been to Singapore fundamentally misunderstand the nature of the police in Singapore.  It is not the case that the police enforces its will ( or that of the state) and the people go with it. You'll find that the police presence here is minimal with the exception of antiterror security at high human traffic areas (train stations, the airport). Much of the police is conscripted and they would prefer to avoid any kind of work.  What is the case is that the people enforce their will and they are happy to tap on state instruments to do so. Amos Yee, the boy charged in court for insulting several religions in a series of videos, could have avoided all of this had multiple people not make numerous police reports against the boy. (as a side note many thought he deserved a good hard punishment; one man even took the liberty to give the boy a slap on the face as he left court- the man was jailed too). Smoke or litter or make noise in dense high rise apartments and your neighbors will call the cops on you. People here are generally very happy to get the state to shut you down if you threaten their sense of space and propriety in any way.  The country is small, and everybody is trying their best to keep their personal life in order. Causing difficulties in the social arrangement is a quick way to make yourself unwelcome and fellow citizens will be quick to have you taken away. Imagine living in a city sized homeowners association, as it were.| 4| 2016-04-26 08:38:35

I think many would agree that inculcating curiousity and critical thinking in our young is important.

news| GloriousNK| Nope, don't confuse me with colonial loving pricks. We ought to look up to Great Leader as the role model of what all human should be.  Something completely true to my real opinion: There really is too little benefit to legalizing drug use over here and therefore lacks popular support, btw a notable majority in the country is the christian conservatives. Do not like it when others boo us for intolerance or somehow inhumane/less humane. We have about one million muslims well integrated into society without erasing their cultural &amp; religious identities, we show tolerance when it is beneficial, and drug abusers are too minor a problem to relax the harsh stance. That Amos Yee shit did more to setback liberal movement than to advance it, only good thing he did is highlighting the fucked up policy of government suppression of political opinions.| 0| 2016-04-22 15:30:25
Foodforthought| Beaglers| I feel that this article seems to be crafted from Googling instead of proper in-depth research. For example, Amos Yee is probably the least objective people to ask for quotes. You might as well quote Donald Trump when writing on New York.| 1| 2016-04-22 15:15:24
singapore| mrdoriangrey| Yeah. I get that they need to provide the context for the article, but they're seriously laying it on thick in almost every article talking about Singapore's society.  People don't realise that Guardian takes a view as a far-off spectator. Their article sources and facts seem to be crafted from the first things they find when Googling 'Singapore issues' instead of proper in-depth research. I'm not saying that these issues don't exist, but that the Guardian (and many other media outlets) blow it out of proportion and don't give a broad and fair view of matters.   Just for this article, KJ and Amos Yee are probably two of the least objective people to ask for quotes.  This article talks about Singapore being meticulously planned (it's in the bloody headline), but there isn't any mention of Lim Kim San? All the writer did was plonk LKY's name everywhere when Lim Kim San was the man behind HDB's success. No wonder people frequently think that "LKY is the one who did everything in Singapore and is worshipped as such."   Many Singaporeans recognise the contribution of the pioneer ministers like Ong Pang Boon and Goh Keng Swee, but misinformed articles like these from a 'reputable' source skews the perspective.| 16| 2016-04-22 13:30:35
Foodforthought| zhemao| I think the part about the "draconian policies" is interesting to analyse.  &gt; such as corporal punishment for acts of vandalism  Yeah, that does seem harsh. But if you think about it, the people who commit vandalism are usually delinquent young men. I'm sure the purpose of this policy is to "set them straight" so to speak. At any rate, it's better than throwing them in jail, which makes them more likely to fall into criminality.  &gt; a ban on the importation of chewing gum  Having walked on the gum-covered sidewalks of New York before, I wouldn't mind this at all. It's chewing gum, it literally serves no purpose other than to keep your mouth busy and rot your teeth.  &gt; urine detectors installed in elevators  Would you rather the staff not know when someone pisses in the elevator? I mean, you would think these wouldn't be necessary, but apparently they are.  &gt; and expression-limiting laws of the kind that put Amos Yee on trial  I definitely agree that this is too harsh. The law against insulting other people's religion may have been a necessary measure to stamp out the ethnic and religious conflict that marred Singapore's early days of independence, but Singapore is probably well-integrated enough now that they are no longer necessary. And their libel laws make it too easy for the government to shut down their political opponents. | 9| 2016-04-22 00:49:17

I think the most recent cases are [The Real Singapore](http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/the-real-singapore-duo/1782756.html) and [Amos Yee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Yee). | 1| 2016-04-19 11:22:16
singapore| [deleted]| I don't think Amos Yee presents a threat to anyone, haf the government ignored it he hardly would have been relevant.  Anyways you're quite right about the size thing. I think SG has been successful about 90% of policies. And thats a really high number. No place is perfect.

singapore| [deleted]| Do you have an opinion on the establishment being overly concerned about its own stability?  For example, in India with staggering no. of people, an individual's opinions and likes/dislikes mean shit.  People can openly make caricatures of many religious prophets and sure there are protest and stuff(we even have a specialised riot control force LOL) but in general the populace does not give too hoots about any of this. There was a controversial section call Sec66 a of the IT act here which caused a few cases like that of Amos Yee but after some public disapproval, it got scrapped. | -2| 2016-04-19 01:30:50
singapore| [deleted]| Wow, we have this kind of shit in India as well, but freedom of speech means people are rarely taken in custody unless the public at large knows the said person is involved in opening waging war/seditious acts against India. So it's basically some fringe groups whose leaders are taken into preventive custody whenever something controversial is about to happen.  Youth in India is generally not so involved in Politics. They are more concerned about their own lives. I think he's an idiot. He didn't use his advantages wisely. He could have played a much longer/ effective game if he wanted to, but now he comes off as 12 year old.  Disclaimer: I am neither in support/against Amos Yee. It's purely a SG internal matter.  On an unrelated note, what can I do about an asshole customs official at the Changi airport? We did report him for threatening us, but we never bothered to follow it up for fear of being denied entry in the future.  *edit* Forgot to thank you.| 1| 2016-04-19 00:18:54

singapore| llosa| Since Roger Ebert is no longer around, I guess someone has to write a review of Amos' newest train wreck. Disclaimer: I am an atheist but not an Amos Yee fan.  **The Good**  While you may wonder why any Amos Yee critique has a 'good' section, well, one must render to the Joker what is the Joker's.   - His acting and delivery are still as intense and maniacal as ever. Special mention: 'You didn't know that! You did not know all the facts!' at 5:10, reminded me of South Park's Michael Jackson 'That's ignorant'.   - Amos Yee as a PORN STAR giving himself a Bible bukkake: 6:20. He's pretty good at this, might be a viable alternative career.   - Humanist beliefs rather elegantly stated at 7:30. If the whole video was about these 20 seconds, then it would actually be no more offensive than /r/atheism.   - Amos mimes being 'burned' at 15:41, but he looks like he's giving birth to a demon baby. Must watch.  **The Bad**  - The first thing I noticed was his hair. His coiffure has suffered. Dank locks but no dank memes to make up for them.   - Ain't nobody got time for that. He goes off on a tangent after minute 8 which continues until minute 11. Seriously, this part is more boring than an actual sermon. It appears Amos has become what he fears the most: a naggy old man. You can really see his energy and accent flagging here. As my old drama instructor would have said, 'BORING'.   - 'I will personally chop off my dick if God is real' at 14:12. He knows that nobody can prove anything, so another empty threat.   - 'You cannot cherry-pick from the Bible'...but then what are you doing Amos? 14:45  - Oh no. MAJOR **Hitler** moment at 20:05 onwards. Nuremberg Rally stuff here. "Together...we will annihilate you...you wretched Christian shits." I didn't put this in the 'Ugly' category only because I'm pretty sure it was an intentional allusion.   **The Ugly**  - Amos sounds a lot like **Kong Hee** at certain moments. Compare 11:30 to 12:04 with any Kong Hee sermon. While they preach completely opposite messages, it's a sad thought that in some alternate universe, Amos might have started his own cult.   - He goes into this weird Shakespearean monologue at 16:45 which continues all the way to 17:50. I really don't know what's going on here. He's staring at the screen like a cut-rate Hamlet at Yorick's skull.   - 18:50 onwards: Conflates religious belief with all the evil in the world, including mass corporations, then tries to exhort the proletariat of the world with the line:   "I WILL NOT STAND IDLE BY AS I SEE THIS WIDE SPREAD RETARDATION SPREADING! **WILL YOU STAND IDLE BY AS I RAPE YOUR MOTHER?**" (19:47)  -  22:22 Amos creates a new 'sign of the Cross', which unsurprisingly has a surprising ending.   Overall: Would not watch again, but it was overall quite engaging. 5/10 as a Youtube video, 3/10 as social commentary, but I'd give it 8/10 as an audition video for a play. He's a good actor, maybe he shouldn't be allowed to write his own scripts. | 20| 2016-04-15 11:17:01

singapore| llosa| I've never applied for USP but:   - Shirt, tie, and pants is good. No jeans.   - More important than dress is hair and face. If you have glasses, wear them, don't squint. BRUSH YOUR TEETH THOROUGHLY. Don't wear a very strong cologne, just eau de toilette/aftershave/take a shower right beforehand. Make sure your hair is brushed out of your face but not slicked/gelled down. If you're male, then this part is easier; if you're female, you need to moderate the makeup. Focus on building a smooth foundation but don't wear heavy eyeliner and keep colours natural. Eyeshadow/blush are not necessary.   - They'll ask you what questions you have, so do some research beforehand. I like asking questions about the amount and quality of contact professors get with students. I also like asking what I should do, as a prospective student, to prepare for the programme. Don't act as if you've gotten in, but definitely demonstrate proactive enthusiasm.   - Have a good knowledge of current affairs, especially relating to your field. Eg. If you want to do journalism, know about the Panama Papers. If you want to do history or politics, know a little about the migrant crisis in Europe. Bonus points if you can link it to future problems that SG might face.  - Don't mention anything that could be construed as anti-establishment or awkward. For example, you probably don't want to weigh in on the famiLee feud or on Amos Yee.   - For any question they give you, try to keep to the following answer structure: PENIS.  Eg. 'What is the greatest challenge you have faced?' With questions like these, they don't want to hear a sob story; they actually want to hear 1) what was the challenge and why 2) HOW YOU OVERCAME IT.   P - Point. 'The greatest challenge I have faced would be overcoming dyslexia to publish my book.'  E - Elaborate. 'I have had dyslexia since age 3, and it caused me much grief in my primary school years. While I learned to cope with my condition and excelled in secondary school, writing a book was still a major challenge. I overcame it by working on paper...*blah blah...this is your bullshit time to shine...*'   N - Negate possible opposition. 'While you might expect me to face difficulties with USP because of my dyslexia, I believe that the strategies I have developed to complete my book can be applied to my university studies...'   I - Illustrate how your experience can help you in the future.  '...because I have learned X, Y, and Z.'  S - Stop gracefully. 'Indeed, writing a book was my greatest challenge, but I am happy to have had the experience, because it has not only taught me what I *can* do, but what my limits are.'   As long as you keep referencing the question, you will not seem to go off topic.   - Final tip: If you don't understand anything, ASK. If you need more time to think, ASK. Don't just chiong blindly.| 2| 2016-04-11 21:02:16

Brunei| sec5| Change is good and change is inevitable. Some short term changes are difficult but if they ultimately lead to improvement then it can be justified. The great lie is that all nations experience change positively, when change is actually volatile like the stock market with its ups and downs, and in some cases it's a complete collapse. Change needs to come in measured quantities and it's safe to say that if there is such sudden change for such a small country, then it is not the type of change that's good.  To add onto that, Brunei is also by most accounts thus far a successful and prosperous state. Many attribute this to oil. But we see in case studies that mineral wealth in emerging countries in fact actually tend to head towards corruption and state collapse resulting in warlords and sectarian violence which is evident in African and gulf states (oil). Western intervention and attempts to implement free elections and regime change almost always takes a turn in a darker direction. Analysts today mostly agree that it would have been a lot better if Saddam Hussein was kept in power than the mess that is IS that we have today.  It's not too far different in Brunei. the fact of the matter is that the culture and mentality of the locals are still developing and can't be changed overnight. A sudden change in leadership results in religious backlash of which is being hinted currently in Brunei. A complete regime change would be a disaster for Brunei and the status quo currently might not be perfect but it has served the country well relatively to almost every other nation on earth. ( Brunei has some of the highest income per capita and quality of life indexes in the world among the developing countries and even compete along with first world countries.)  This is the drawback of western influence and western styled education where students are exposed only to the superficial surface ideas of democracy, secularism and modernity and fail to actually flip through the pages of history books to see how it's actually failed to serve developing nations. Singapore as an example and even Malaysia was well known to be pretty iron fisted in the days of LKY and Mahatir, and arguably is still so in LHLs Singapore today.   If your interested you can look into SG50 broadcasts between key ministers and foreign thinkers. Fareed Zakaria was trying to criticize LHL (but LHL gave really excellent rebuttals) on how Singapore was still considered backwards despite its ultra modernity, on issues like free press, political suppression, limited citizen rights (e.g to protest), Disneyland with the death penalty, prisoner rights etc. Recent issues like Amos Yee being sued in court and Roy Cherng add to this.   Park Chung Hee was also the iron man for S.Korea and is responsible for the success it is today and that's an interesting case study as well. Frankly, American styled democracy and election is pretty much a joke to me. It worked well for FDR up to JFK but the way it is now, its broken and malfunctioning as it can't manage and represent the country and public interest well enough.  I find it all very curious because on this subreddit, you find many many proponents of democracy and western (American) secularism, because they watched a few Obama speeches and a few marvel movies and now think that that's the way to go, but are really shortsighted and naive about politics and administration in general to fully understand these ideologies properly, and see how it is probably detrimental to the country if adopted in full.   The political administrations that have worked well for Asia has always been a type of fusion between east and west. If you asked me I'd say they've gotten it right in China, Japan and some European countries like Germany. If full on democracy was introduced to China it would result in a worldwide collapse. And we see it failing in India as it has failed to take off properly despite its size, resources, and development.| 3| 2016-04-07 12:29:58

singapore| the_rumblebee| I don't think you quite understand, she isn't Amos Yee.   The Real Singapore, for 16 months, churned out lies about the government and Singaporeans, spreading a large amount of negative sentiments. Kind of like The Onion, but the sad thing is everyone thought they were serious, and it wasn't satire.  Read [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20141231211350/http://therealsingapore.com/content/ex-st-journalist-tessa-wong-now-works-bbc-criticises-singaporeans) article they put out. Then read the [original](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-28953147) article they reference. Note the difference in tone, and message- while the original article by Tessa Wong is about how Singaporeans need to be more accepting of Filipinos, TRS flipped the article on its back and wrote, "If Tessa is to be believed, Singaporeans are mud-slinging buggers full of contempt and hatred towards Filipinos."  And that's not just a one-off thing, they did this all the fucking time. My friends would post some idiotic TRS article on Facebook, ranting about the Govt, and I would make them look like an idiot in 20 seconds with a link to the original article.   She's not a journalist- she's a spin doctor, a manipulator, and a very good one at that, to have earned almost $500k doing it. Pregnant? So what?

LtCorbis| lihtt99line| &gt;If you say "because of pyro", you're right.  Pyro may have given her a shoutout but he's not responsible for the lieutenants content. Contrary to /u/Lyratheflirt's scientific thesis that "She was put down on this earth by a higher being known as Pyrocynical" I believe that Pyro does not put his subjects on this Earth but merely comments on videos already out there in the ether of the net. His commentary on LtCorbis' video about how to be "original" on Youtube consisted of praise, and rightfully so, but it also raised some questions about the state of the Youtube community. But her popularity is an interesting question that I've wondered about myself when watching her videos.   &gt;She posts more frequently than Baman.  The lieutenant had made 25 videos before Pyro's shoutout. She gained a lot of subscribers even before posting her next video. So I don't think frequency of update is not a decisive factor but rather the content of videos already uploaded. The second reason is actually a three-part argument. I'll elaborate these one at a time on the basis of my own experience. I watched "Buzzfeed vs Men" because a girl in my dorm linked it to me on Facebook chat and said that *she wants to be like LtCorbis when she grows up*. (The dorm-mate is in her mid-twenties.) She recommended the lieutenant's video on Buzzfeed vs Men. I had earlier discussed feminism with this girl, and she sent me the link because the lieutenant defined the distinction between feminists and feminazis in it. I'm still on the fence about the distinction, but I did like LtCorbis' presentation. So lets look at the partitioned arguments.  &gt;Her age is a factor  It most definitely is. I suspect that the video of her roasting Buzzfeed was uploaded to Facebook by an anti-feminist group because she's cute. It probably bolstered the anti-feminist argument that even children know that Buzzfeed and the feminist agenda are messed up. It's interesting to hear a child talk sense. I think it might be a cultural motif, a historical meme so-to-say. Jesus Christ was supposedly very learned when he was a child. I think there's a very real fascination with children who demonstrate intellectual development. I'd summarize or abstract Pyro's concern with the situation as concerning because it's related to the concern over effects that our newest technologies might have for the next generations of humans. There probably aren't any longitudinal studies of children development and computer technologies. We're seeing something first-hand that we can only later explain. Children have always been creative, inventive, and innovative - as well as hard-working and dedicated - but now we're beginning to see this trait in the online environment, and probably on a global scale. It might be a thing we'll start to see regularly. For example, just a year ago there was a similar fascination with Amos Yee, a 16-year-old Signapore boy who politically criticised and insulted the deeply respected former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, who is seen as the country's founding father ([BBC article on the subject](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-32604122)). Amos Yee, too, did this on Youtube, and [his channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/BrainAndButter) still exists, although he himself probably carries on as a political prisoner. With Amos, the world was sorta amazed that a 16-year-old can have refined and intelligible political opinions.   &gt;as such original content is rare nowadays  I don't think original content is rare nowadays. There's more content now than ever, so there's bound to be more original content amidst all the clones and unoriginality. It's possible that the impression of no original content forms so easily because your own habits have become hyper-centralized via "content mediators" like all these users who make video game commentaries. In actual fact there's more original content on Youtube than ever, but it's difficult to see the forest through the trees. The linguistic quirk here is the modifier "as such", which would imply that the type of original content that's rare nowadays is the content of little children. I watched a series of videos by Leafy and Pyro after watching through LtCorbis' channel, and much of it consists of criticism of childrens videos. Pyro essentially stumbled on a child youtuber with minimal levels of cringe, but the matter of fact is that these channels - even LtCorbis' - roast children, idiots or autists, and celebrities (or ideally, people who embody all of these). If it gets down to it, I wouldn't call it very original content. LtCorbis is not doing something that hasn't been done before, and she acknowledges this in her own videos. It's pretty cookie-cutter content but made interesting by the fact that she's a little girl, and not a (young) adult man as is more common.      &gt;never before has it been done by an 11 year old  In all likelihood it actually has, but this is one of the latest case and as the hyper-centralization of the internet progresses, we'll probably start to see it increasing in frequency and magnitude. LtCorbis might look like she "is not an ordinary child" as the pseudo-scientist attests, at least when looked at individually, but I think it likely that there are many children who are already making content acceptable for older demographics of viewers. LtCorbis is just the current such child and her particular 15 minutes of fame might easily pass sooner than we think. Recall [kitty pryde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SDYus7iKC8), the 15-year-old girl rapper who became a meme on /mu/ for her iPhone-recorded raps over MF Doom beats in 2012. Last I heard of her was a year ago when she made a Kickstarter campaign to release her ["First Big-Girl Record"](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kittysalbum/kittys-first-big-girl-record-help-make-it-amazing). A not-too-cringy teenage rapping, too, was considered "never before done", but actually it had, there are numerous examples even in my own small European country ([such as this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zor--DNv8Oo)). What made kitty pryde and LtCorbis stand out was probably their gender and the cuteness factor. Something something double standards, *wow gurlz kann do stuffs*.   &gt;The rise of commentary youtubers.   I think I might have already addressed this. It's interesting in itself that we're at a stage where we can draw clear distinctions between types of video game videos (e.g. playthroughs, tutorials, and commentaries). There are probably more of these types (e.g. video game demos/trailers, videos about video game culture, etc.), but the commentary seems to be the one currently achieving a fulcrum and disseminating profusely. I've even seen some older Youtubers who are otherwise not very notorious gamers make a separate video game channel. It's a trend, a fad. That's why Leafy clones are a current topic. But I don't think people like this shit all that much. The popular channels with 200K+ subscribers are few and far between all the unsuccessful, unsubscribed commentary channels that are all eerily similar in lacking a memorable personality. The rise of commentary youtubers might have given LtCorbis a platform but I don't think it's the reason why she stands out. At best it's a contributing factor.  &gt;People need a new meme. Enough said.  This is a great way to explain it, but I doubt if it's a verifiable reason. I'd argue that in that sense she's not even a new meme. As I noted somewhere above, the idea of a gifted child is a well-established one. For example, *enfant terrible* is a French expression for a child who is terrifyingly candid by saying embarrassing things to parents or others (i.e. "MattyB, please fertilize my eggs"). One of the things Pyro remarked was Corbis' buttfuck-cuntaculously foul mouth. (That last sentence reads like poetry.) But I haven't actually noticed too many novel memes in her content. She's more of a disseminator of memes rather than a progenitor. She's no one-girl-4chan. Most of her active memes seem borrowed, i.e. "Lets peep this out." At one point I even heard her say "hide yo kids, hide yo wife". I don't think new memes are a necessity for people, but it does make people who communicate via memes more "relatable". She probably owes much of her success to the wit and humour that our current meme culture affords her. As the scientist put it, "The element of memes has enhanced her abilities in all aspects." But yeah, she's a meme herself, and it may explain her ultimate fading out of relevance. *Memes come, memes go; Live by the meme, die by the meme; Meme in, meme out; M.E.M.E.L.I.F.E.*, etc.  &gt;Actual quality content.  With this I agree. Her video editing skills far surpass many. Her wit and humour, although meme-tinted, is relatable. Her observations about the Youtube community are currently relevant, and her criticisms make sense. But I can't hold back the pessimism oozing out of every one of these paragraphs I've written. It's likely that her success is a fluke and the relatively simplistic and object-focused content may give way to her enjoying the smell of her own flatulence. It seems like the natural course of events at this point that when someone gets hit with online success their views of the world ossify and they become more self-centered. 3 out of 5 of LtCorbis' videos after she blew up have been about her and her channel. Becoming popular comes with a loss of autonomy because people have expectations and this can be pressuring. So while quality content is a definite reason for her channel growing so fast, it might also become her ultimate downfall because it's difficult to put out original content week after week after week.   ***TL;DR:*** She doesn't post all that frequently; her age is definitely a factor but so is her gender; she stands out among commentary youtubers; her wit and humour are memetic; actual quality content may be a bit of an overstatement but most here would probably agree to it.| 1| 2016-03-23 18:24:29
PoliticalDiscussion| ElvenAshwin| Singaporean here. Plenty of people whine and rage about the government online and IRL, and the government usually ignores it. But it *is* possible for them to arrest you, they just choose not to arrest people unless there is significant support among the population (As is the case in the Amos Yee incident, where a 16 year old pissed off enough Singaporeans to get jailed for a month).  So it's a bit of a grey area. Which is clever on the governments part - you don't feel oppressed, but if need be they can clamp down on you.| 2| 2016-03-23 15:46:23

singapore| NO_LAH_WHERE_GOT| Haha. My point was that I was kinda more or less doing all of those things too when I was his age.   That said, I think 17yo's talking about life are mostly just preaching at other people in the hope that they'll be validated for it. (And if they get people attacking or insulting them for it, they now have "enemies" that define them.) Applies to Amos Yee, applies to this dude, and applied to me when I was younger.  I'm still pretty mouthy though; the only thing that's changed is that I'm a little busier because of bills and work and stuff. But I'm still fundamentally troubled by how modern civilization works (see: Ken Robinson, Richard Feynman, Nassim Taleb, etc. etc. etc).   I just have less time to bitch about it on my blog now, and am more focused on things like "how can I save money on food by preparing my meals in advance".| 4| 2016-03-21 15:45:38
singapore| NO_LAH_WHERE_GOT| I started out exactly as a tone-deaf amos yee-ish 18yo anti-academic kid. Am now 25 going on 26, manage a marketing team for a software company, married with HDB and am doing pretty well for myself.   but I get your point; it's a challenging path.  also, the "overly stressed, overly-paper-qualification-obssessed" point has been going on for literally like 50 years. Mary Lee wrote about it in 1974: https://web.archive.org/web/20140208190820/http://sharankaurner.wordpress.com/2013/09/01/the-great-paper-chase-by-mary-lee-1974/| 5| 2016-03-21 14:37:42
singapore| erenold_of_auxerre| While not discounting his larger point - that we're an overly-stressed, overly-paper-qualification-obsessed society - a 19yo is really not a particularly good vehicle for this kind of life "advice". There's an tone-deaf Amos Yee-ishness about a teenager with mediocre digital capabilities selling this kind of anti-academic message.  I hope his website and his YouTube work out, not for a few months or years but for his entire life. Because he's kind of screwed, otherwise.| 16| 2016-03-21 09:08:53
funny| zambazzar| Tbh Singapore is amazing. I thought it was shitty and small and boring at some points in time but as I grow up and approached my 20s I realise that the government has really done a good job with the late Lee Kwan Yew having brought us out of a third world country status into a major player in international business.   Having said that, it's true that free speech is quite tightly regulated here. Everyone here is tech savvy and anything said here in this small country can easily spread like wildfire, anybody would hear about it as soon as it hits the airwaves.   As an example, a 17 year old blogger, Amos Yee caused quite a stir right after LKY passed on, making derogatory statements and pictures of Christians, the late prime minister and Margaret Thatcher. He was arrested for his little attention seeking stunt and it drew much criticism internationally. However from a Singaporeans point of view, it was very much unneeded. Making a wrongful claim against a man, who in good spirit went out of his way to bail him out had molested him. Seeing how news coverage nowadays typically focuses on bringing out the more controversial segments to draw in more views, all I saw was people from overseas slamming the Singaporean government without having an insiders point of view.   All in all, people in Singapore do have their own points of views and they're allowed to express it as long as it conforms to some civil standard/community guidelines. Nothing happens here without someone hearing about it and any truly repressive acts would be swiftly picked up on and broadcast to everybody. To expatriates, Singapore ranks highly on the list of countries to live in, and great to raise children in, even if costs are expensive, thanks to great childcare systems and educational systems. Britain's educational minister himself expressed that maybe the UK should adopt a system like ours.   Of course, this is just my point of view, but I hope it answers your question well enough!

A lot of these youtubers try so hard to give their accent an ang moh twang, it ends up sounding so strange and hokey pokey. Amos Yee was the most extreme example, but most of them have the same problem.  Just speak naturally! There's nothing wrong with sounding Singaporean. I think Jade Seah has one of the most natural voices - it's clear and she enunciates well, but without the ang moh twang, so it's unmistakably Singaporean.| 20| 2016-03-09 03:26:16
singapore| NEWater| You must not know American politics very well.  &gt;Trump is on the conservative end of the political spectrum not authoritarian.  Talk to any self-declared GOP conservative and they will laugh at you for suggesting Trump is a conservative in the US context. [Trump's economic policies are one of the most liberal from the GOP in recent history](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-is-the-most-liberal-republican-on-economics-since-nixon-2015-12-14). Universal healthcare, attacking large corporations for special interest lobbying in Washington, attacking free trade with China and calling for "fair trade", and slightly higher taxes on the wealthy? GOP conservatives are frothing in the mouth at the thought that their party's front-runner is promoting all of the above. Trump isn't a conservative rep, and Ted Cruz is the Tea Party darling candidate for good reason.  &gt;He may want to enact laws that give the presidency more power  That is an indicator of authoritarianism. [Here's an explanation of who's voting for Trump and why: he "embodies the leadership style most desired by these authoritarians: 'simple, powerful and punitive.'"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-the-authoritarians-candidate-of-choice/2016/03/04/2840f798-e15c-11e5-9c36-e1902f6b6571_story.html) Our brand of multiculturalism exists because it was pushed through via punitive force of the government, and we continue to be very open to foreigners because of the authoritarian nature of "gahmen knows best" to keep it that way despite how unpopular it has been in the past 5 years or so.   Moreover, Americans are huge sticklers for rule of law, and there are aspects of our society which will repel them. The treatment of under-18s like Amos Yee, [the 5 teens punished for insulting the PAP by revealing their faces on national press](http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/toa-payoh-graffiti-case-five-youths-charged-vandalism) and the recent callousness with Benjamin Lee all fly in the face of how we're supposed to be protecting minors from punitive punishment. Let's not even get into the 377A issue and how we're supposed to have a law in the books but don't really enforce it, because muh conservative society or muh Asian values or whatever. The left-leaning Americans who are likely to want to move out because of a President Trump will find these things distasteful. | -1| 2016-03-07 19:30:13

worldnews| skatyboy| Hmm, I think it's not easy to realise that the arrest of Amos Yee is not something that the government does to clamp down on dissident, but rather, to maintain it's support base amongst religious Singaporeans. If they had let him rattle about Christianity, Buddhism and Islam, the opposition parties could step in and say that they would prevent such a thing from happening.  One must realise that the PAP operates on an ideology of pragmatism, rather than based on what is right. It's not going to benefit Singapore if Amos Yee either: 1) makes PAP lose its religious support base or 2) cause another racial/religious riot, which would definitely grind Singapore's economy down to a halt.  Just my two cents on that issue that keeps popping up on Reddit when it comes to Singapore.| 3| 2016-02-06 15:14:02
worldnews| NoNeed4Amrak| I think the protests have more to do with local governments than the central (federal?) government.

And let's not forget about that teenager who was arrested in Singapore for his speech.   &gt;Hmm, I think it's not easy to realise that the arrest of Amos Yee is not something that the government does to clamp down on dissident, but rather, to maintain it's support base amongst religious Singaporeans.

What has freedom of press got to do with what I'm saying? I don't think the ST has any qualms at all about publishing critical articles about foreign lands. They certainly took some shots at the U.S. during the Michael Fay incident.  I see CSJ as a grown-up Amos Yee, to be honest. I mean grown-up, because the former has (at least, currently) more maturity than the latter in publishing his views - Amos likes to rant and rave and troll Singapore on YouTube, while CSJ likes to do the same thing, in print in foreign publications and in a more measured manner. Reading between the lines, there's not much difference in either of their rhetoric. | 2| 2016-01-22 23:31:16

IBO| llosa| The best timetable software is yourself. I'm not saying this because I'm old fashioned (though I am), but because you need to commit to something you've created yourself.  Let me know which days you study (mon - Fri or weekends too) and I will make a timetable for you. This timetable will last 2 weeks but you can just repeat it or change it after the first fortnight.   Have you checked out [Bioninja](http://www.ib.bioninja.com.au/standard-level/topic-1-statistical-analysi/)? It is not yet phrased in terms of the 2016 Bio syllabus but much of the content is the same. I did not study from textbooks at all, 100% Bioninja and past papers.  More Bio tips:   1. Key words. If you look at a mark scheme, everything is given in point form. If you have the correct 'word', you will get a mark. If not, you could be Louis Pasteur himself and they would still give you nothing. For example:   'Explain the need for ventilation in humans'.   A 'logical' answer would be: 1) humans are large mammals 2) not enough air can be taken in through the skin 3) hence a mechanical respiratory system is needed to maintain high oxygen concentration in blood.  This answer would get ZERO marks in the exam. Instead they want to see: 'Maintains high concentration in alveoli' and 'gas exchange'. This is a pretty lousy answer IMO but these 2 points are needed to get 2/2 in the exam. So the lesson is, do past papers and copy down the answers. Memorise the answers, not the actual 'information' that is biologically correct according to the textbook.  Also for Bio...because of this keyword system, you should try to maximise your chances of getting something right. Hence, write more answers than necessary. They don't deduct for wrong keywords but only mark for the right ones. If you're not sure what enzymes are, don't just write 'globular proteins' or 'biological catalysts' or 'speed up rate of reaction'. Write them all down! The only exception is questions where the number of answers is specified, eg. 'Name ONE structure in a plant cell'. Then, the FIRST one you write down is marked, so make sure it's your best guess.   TOK Presentation: Do something that hasn't been rehashed to death. If you are from a non-US country, do your presentation about something from your home country. In your case, focus on Canadian issues...or even better, local issues. If you live in, say, Quebec...do it on something Quebecois. I did mine on a Singaporean dissident, Amos Yee. Nobody had ever heard of him so they were less likely to ask difficult questions.   Also, make sure your presentation skills are good. Never ever use cue cards. Obama might be able to use them, but most students end up getting nervous and playing with the cards or looking down constantly. Consider Prezi instead of Powerpoint for a more 'designer' feel. Add images. You can even put in short snippets, say about 20 seconds of a video. Practice practice practice - do a practice run in front of your teacher/class if possible.  Language B: Immersion is the key word. Your classmates, if they were anything like mine, are more interested in chatting in English than actually speaking French. Seek out opportunities outside school to speak French - go to a French language group or something. Read French books. Listen to French music - Frero de la Vega is popular in France at the moment, if you want a starting point. Alizee was the Britney Spears of France. Maxime le Forestier was like Simon and Garfunkel. Watch French movies online. The textbook will not teach you much...you need to expand vocabulary as much as possible.  I will create a separate post this week discussing Language B exam strategies. The exam actually helps you guess the right answer. | 2| 2016-01-05 17:34:59

Some have claimed he misused the internal security act to jail, exile and bankrupt his political rivals.

What we're not allowed to do is be dicks about it.   Amos Yee wasn't arrested for saying "Thank Goodness LKY is dead", nor was he arrested for posting on his Twitter that he just jacked off to a girl he met at a convention. He was arrested for insulting a religious group.   And while it's arguable that he deserves the right to do so, really- what good will that do? If you have a scenario on-hand that would explain how any good could possible come of people freely posting "fuck Islam", I'd love to hear it.  On the other hand, I can tell you about the negative things that could come from such remarks being tossed around freely. Racial discrimination, rioting, general disturbance of the peace- basically, all the goodwill we share as a nation could go down the drain. Is freedom of speech really such a great thing that we're willing to risk  the peace we enjoy? I personally don't think so.| 2| 2015-12-16 23:27:24

singapore| IvanLu| It's worth pointing out that equally tortured logic was used to prosecute what a 17 year old kid posted on his blog.  EDIT: With respect to the badly drawn "obscene" image Amos posted on his blog, the judge [ruled that](http://www.dodwell-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Amos-Yee-Judgment-dated-12.05.15.pdf):  &gt; The defence acknowledged that such an image may have a tendency to lead towards sexual experimentation. I agree that it would encourage sexual precociousness. **In my judgment, such an image would not only tend to excite teenagers to try out different sexual positions but also deviant sexual activity, i.e., anal intercourse. Such sexual desires and lascivious thoughts would have a corrupting effect on young minds.** Accordingly, I am satisfied that the image has a tendency to corrupt and deprave.  Really? So teenagers who have the whole of the world wide web at their fingertips (including innumerable actual unblocked obscene websites), and chanced upon Amos Yee's laughably bad Photoshopped drawing (which is more of political insult with shock value) would be tempted to try out anal sex as a result?  Furthermore I should add it's not even clear that the defence, as the judge claimed, had acknowledged the image may lead to such tendencies. The defence wrote:  &gt; However, on the present case, there is no such effect which the Prosecution can point toward as meeting the high threshold of “deprave and corrupt”. **Taking the Prosecution’s case at its highest**, the influence of the Image on the Likely Viewers is such that it **may** either (a) lead them toward being disrespectful or vulgar; or (b) lead them toward sexual experimentation. This does not meet the test of having a tendency to “deprave and corrupt”.   Somehow the judge must have missed the bolded part, which equates to saying "*Assuming* you are right..." in an argument.| 12| 2015-12-16 20:02:06
worldnews| nomad80| Amos Yee arguably, *actually* got in trouble for disparaging the founding father of Singapore. The focus on religion was just a easy way to eliminate the angle of action being taken for  political dissent| 1| 2015-12-16 19:25:23
worldnews| denunciator| Singapore on the front page in a post not about Amos Yee? Well I'll be.  It's interesting that the title uses the word secularism. Secularism, as it is understood in Western parlance, implies a strict separation of church and state. However, Singapore's brand (or rather, the incumbent government's brand) of secularism is a twist on traditional pluralist secularism. The institution of religion is subjugated to the institution of the state; specifically, religion is allowed to not just exist, but thrive - insofar as it 1) does not attempt to influence politics; and 2) its interests are in line with or result in the advancement of the interests of the state.   In extension, then, we should examine the purpose behind the social contract as outlined above. In the posts in this thread, the discourse of the incumbent government (hereafter referred to as the PAP or 'the state') is aired widely. Being the dominant narrative taught to citizens in school, it should be immediately obvious why the voices of Singaporeans are in such agreement. This narrative is factually correct, but doesn't adequately explain a number of things:  1) The conflation between race and religion    2) The extensiveness of Acts related to religion in Singapore    3) The uncertainty of state discourse as to the state of religious harmony, and therefore    4) The continued existence of the Acts as they had been introduced decades ago.  1) is the easiest to answer. In the construction of the individual as a citizen, one is often given a set of discrete identities. One might be male, Caucasian, American, and so on; in Singapore, in particular, race, religion and language are viewed as being not just related, but inter-dependent identities. The construction of a citizen as an ethnic Malay (a race) is related to their construction as a follower of Islam and a speaker of Bahasa Melayu.  It may seem immediately obvious that this should be the case, especially to Singaporeans, but it's not necessary at all. Despite this, the vast majority of society is carved into sectors with each being given an ethnicity, a religion and one of a small set of ethnic languages. Students are expected to be proficient in at least one of these languages related to their ethnicity. The construction of an overarching identity serves, ironically, to divide rather than to unite.   Why? This question could be answered a hundred different valid ways. Some point to the former leader, Lee Kuan Yew's personal views on ethnicity; others would describe it as a result of of heritage, or tradition. Yet others would talk about it as a tool of control and subjugation. Regardless of your views, it is vitally important to understand that the state conflates religion and race, as we move to the next point:  2) The Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act and Sedition Act are extremely contentious pieces of legislation among Singapore's academia. Particularly, social scientists view these as tools of control. Very broadly, these acts allow the government to prosecute those who attempt to incite or exploit racial tensions, in particular for political gain. In particular, the MRHA has a proviso that disallows decisions made under it to be challenged or appealed in court.   Because of this, discourse in Singapore - civil or political - treads very carefully around religion (and, by extension, race). Very many countries around the world have had experience with racial tension; it should stand to reason that no party should have the opportunity to gain from exploiting them. However, this is a double-ended instrument; it may also prevent people from exploring legitimate racial issues - issues of privilege, for example.   Why, then, do these continue to exist? We examine some state discourse in answering 3). The posters in this thread are correct - the contemporary Singapore's formative years were tumultuous. Racial tension was a very real part of history, and they blew up into (relatively) bloody riots, not once, but twice. In fact, Singapore's separation from Malaya/Malaysia and subsequent independence were very much predicated on racial tension - Malaya wanted a nation where ethnic Malays (and Muslims) were privileged; the late elder statesman Lee of the PAP disagreed, and this resulted in Singapore's expulsion from the Federation. In state discourse, then, the existence of legislation to control racial and religious discussions is a necessary linchpin for our continued survival as a nation.  However, in the following decades, state discourse has varied. At times, Singapore is a fragile pearl in a sea of greedy divers that has to be coddled and protected no matter the cost - you find this trope a lot among locals, especially in this thread. At other times, however, we are one of the most successfully harmonious utopia in existence and we are a shining paragon of how to manage racial issues.  Both are true, to some extent. To deny so is to deny Singapore's history. However, it is critically important to understand that the continued existence of these pieces of legislation ensure that, no matter what happens, racial and religious issues will never be addressed adequately in civil discourse.   Back to the beginning, then. How does the state benefit from ensuring the sustenance of religious groups and the protection of religion? /u/threesls has a very well-written and concise post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/3sdx3m/see_our_brother_he_sacrificed_for_god_controversy/cwx98zx).   ---  The reason this post was written is to provide some nuance to the views in this thread. Again, they are not factually inaccurate; but to paint these pieces of legislation as styrofoam to protect a little fragile vase fails to fully understand the social and historical context in which they are made. Even so, this post barely scratches the surface.  Anyone interested in more can look up the works of Daniel Goh, Veneeta Sinha and Chua Beng Huat to learn more about the social theories at work here.

worldnews| HiPSTRF0X| Singaporean here.  Just something from our national pledge:  "We, the citizens of Singapore Pledge ourselves as one United people regardless of RACE, LANGUAGE OR RELIGION, to build a democratic society based on justice and equality"  This part alone pretty much justifies equal treatment to everyone.  Majority of laws are created to benefit the Malays (who happen to be majority Muslim) due to our heritage as a Malay fishing village and people tend to see it as protecting just the Muslims in that regard.  Yes. We may be authoritarian and controlling over what majority of people say,  but most of the time the arrests that happen are justified due to these people either being nutjob whackos or complete twats who have a good command of English with a good education but put it to the wrong use.

Alright, equating two seemingly unrelated topics... Amos Yee is vocal, crude and explicitly anti-religion it what has LGBT got to do with it? Oh that's right, you're against LGBT because of your religion and Amos Yee offended your nice little butt.   &gt;Atheism is the religion of the new world order but defending atheism is next to impossible-The sheer stupidity of something coming from nothing and we share the same genes as.....go google...lol.

Defense of atheism near-impossible? Isn't it the other way around? Coming from nothing... Okay this man has clearly no knowledge in science.   &gt;This is not atheism. This Militant atheism.

I'm thinking about doing a course (Caring for Vulnerable Children) but it only starts when JC starts, so I don't know how that'll go.   It's the holidays now, so I'm re-learning French -- Duolingo's good for exposure to vocabulary + spaced repetition (the XP bar helps too because you have something to measure your progress with) but I'm also using my old French textbooks for grammar.   I currently have a holiday job, which is pretty nice for social interaction : ) I'm volunteering next year with a group working with Lakeside Family Services (taking care of kids as their parents attend financial literacy workshops) for... 8 days? I might sign up to volunteer with the National Gallery but I have to see what JC will be like : (  I think I'm trying to learn more in the holidays as the things I'm interested in haven't been covered in school -- I enjoy school (I sense Amos Yee coming after me any moment soon), but only certain parts of it.   I've just checked out the SAftD sign language courses - none of them say that they're a month long, but I gather it's the SgSL one? It's 6 weeks long and $180.

singapore| doctorwhybother98| OP, Singapore is FAR from a utopia.  Singapore is an awesome place if you earn &gt;$80k per annum. Low taxes; if you earn that much you can easily afford a condo or a luxurious HDB apartment; and if you have kids and you want to put them through a rigorous and needlessly stressful education system, then we have just the right system for you; convenient etc.  If you're the type of person who cares deeply about freedom of speech and press, forget about permanently settling in Singapore. Despite all the talk of progress, from the look of things they aren't going to be changing anytime soon. Google: Roy Ngerng Prime Minister defamation suit (highest paid leader in the world suing a private citizen, think about that for a minute); Amos Yee case.   I, a Singaporean, do not wish to spend my life here. It's a playground for the rich, and a living hell for the poor. But what do I have to complain about, even our own PM said "it's better to be poor in Singapore than poor elsewhere"...| 2| 2015-12-15 15:52:33

The media should hound these two monsters for their inhumane acts.  I'll insert a unpopular opinion here : if their children is grown up , it is also a Sin if they ignore the dreadful acts of their parents. In a way, they could be considered as accomplices who did not report the abuse. | 46| 2015-12-14 22:12:07
asexuality| Obversa| Not to mention there is also victim-blaming and hypocrisy abound here.  &gt; So really, I’m the one who wanted to fuck her, but she seemed to be more into it than me, so don’t blame me that I thought she could be willing to reciprocate by sucking my dick...  &gt; ...I wished that once she found out that I was referring to her on my twitter, we could have talked about it between us instead of having her needlessly flame me on twitter (what a cunt). And it was kind of strange to me why she did that because most girls in a similar scenario I would assume, **would have just kept it to themselves, and just ignored the horny person, instead of blatantly declaring it online**; nobody would know I was referring to you on Twitter if you didn’t outright say it. So I’m thinking you either wanted to boast that wow, Amos Yee had a crush on me, but still be like hi I’m not a hoe, or you felt embarrassed by my tweets, so you wanted to make me feel even more embarrassed because you are quote unquote ‘savage’; yeah, that’s probably it.  &gt; ...Which really rochelle calm your tits, we could have just solved this privately between us, interspersed with really rough sex.  What a giant, hypocritical piece of shit. The entire post is vomit-inducing.  &gt; Even though she's being this really biased, emotional savage cunt right now, I still really like her. She’s flaming me on Facebook, and now I’m calling out her bullshit and kind of making fun of her, it’s really turning me on (this is the kind of love-hate relationship that makes really good sex, do consider the offer rochelle).  Correction: "Even though she's being this really biased, emotional savage cunt right now, I still really want to fuck her."  &gt; And you were were the one who came up to me during the convention and wanted to take the selfie, and you were the one who started a Facebook conversation with me talking about the drama of criticizing other people’s cosplay outfits in the cosplay community (Then afterwards I checked your Facebook profile, looked at your pics and continued talking to you, and then I fell in love grin emoticon ) Why do you seem angry and sadistic, complaining and saying I ‘harassed’ you on Facebook? Amos Yee wants to make out with you, you should be honoured.  What...the...*fuck*. This is entirely victim-blaming. Just reading it makes me want to take a shower, because I feel so defiled by it.  &gt; I hope she unblocks me, (and also her friend (you convinced her too huh?)), we have so much more to talk about, and aside from the awkwardness of me wanting to fuck you, we could be good friends. You can totally respect someone as an intelligent person and also want to fuck her; why is there this impression that if you want to fuck someone it’s somehow degrading them? It totally isn’t, at least it shouldn’t be.  "lol, I was jk about all that, wanna fuck and be FWB??"  This is straight-up TRP bullshit.| 5| 2015-12-14 03:55:52

news| KaliYugaz| &gt; If you try to ban an idea, it makes that idea more powerful.  Only if that idea is widely held by a majority of people. It's very easy to crush radical ideas held by a small minority through overt censorship, because nobody else will be inclined to draw attention to their plight or back them up. Just look at the Amos Yee incident in Singapore; the people who turned him in were his own neighbors, and nobody in society really cared that he got punished by the government for his speech.  &gt;Open debate is the best way to combat an idea without inadvertently empowering it.  That's an oversimplification of the issue. Open debate in general is more good than bad, but it still causes important problems that cannot be overlooked. One of those is that the loudest people and the most emotionally resonant opinions will naturally dominate the discussion, regardless of whether they are right or not. Absolute free speech also does not require civility or rationality, allowing discourse to devolve into unproductive shouting matches and dissing contests in which no ideas are really debated at all.  That's why academia is never an entirely free speech environment. Journals regularly turn down papers that are poorly researched and come to stupid, half-baked conclusions. It is considered unprofessional, and even grounds for losing tenure, to use disrespectful slurs on ones colleagues and students, even in the most heated academic debates. It's confusing that people on Reddit think free speech is what universities are for, because it really isn't. The primary mission of a university is to produce true and useful knowledge, and to educate the professional classes of society in that knowledge. And if free speech goes too far into enabling unreason, untruth, and miseducation, then it has to be restricted.| 3| 2015-12-05 00:16:20

NationalSocialism| PanteneNerdAlert| The bolshevists were mainly Chinese. This was true in both Malaysia and Singapore at the time, as in that era the native Chinese populations allied themselves very closely to Mao Zedong because of him being the leader of China. There was no Malaysian or Singaporean Chinese identity to speak of yet, so at that time all the Chinese in Southeast Asia still thought of themselves as of China. This overwhelming population of Chinese bolshevists led to the racial tensions in Singapore and Malaysia.  There was a small possibility that Singapore would have become a communist enclave. One of the conditions the British gave for granting independence was that the fight against the communists would continue. There is, in fact, a graphic novel currently in circulation depicting an alternate timeline in which Lee Kuan Yew's faction was purged by Lim Chin Siong instead of the other way around (http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-33621862)  Lee Hsien Loong has a different vision of how the country should be governed from his father, I think. The different circumstances would also be a factor. Underneath the modern Singapore skyline once stood mudflats 50 years ago; the stark change would probably account for that. You could also factor in the increasing amount of dissent, both intelligent (criticism of insane immigration of Chinese nationals) and unintelligent (blogger Roy Ngerng's campaign to bring down the CPF, upstart punkhead Amos Yee, etc.)  The one guiding force of Singaporean policy which remained constant, I think, is the commitment to increasing foreign investment as a driver of the economy. In Lee Kuan Yew's time, it was extremely important to prove that this small city-state was safe above all else to attract investment. Now we're both rich and safe and have other factors to consider, like political ties to the EU, US, and China which we have to balance out some way or another. | 1| 2015-11-28 11:22:02

india| thisisshantzz| There is no proper opposition because the existing government has been living up to the people's expectations. That is why the people vote for the same government with such a large majority.  &gt; notorious contempt of judiciary law  Source?  Yes, there are restrictions on what you can say in public and I tend to agree with them too. Just because you want to say something does not mean you actually say it. If you are not responsible enough to use power wisely, then you should not be given that power. They learned this lesson when they saw the extremely violent race riots in Malaysia in the 60s and decided not to play around with people's emotions. That is one of the reasons there is communal harmony here. Education is another.  That entire case with Amos Yee proves it. The government did curb his rights to talk shit but the people supported the government on this. That is why the government decided to act. They understand they are not allowed certain things and they live by it.  All this idealistic crap can get annoying. The entire universe itself was never ideal and will never be ideal. Those who learn to live with this fact and make the most of it survive. The others die. Survival of the fittest.

singapore| marcusteh1238| A level student here. Imo there's a list of important things, but first things first is to always know how to analyse the question well.   Make sure you totally understand what the question asks and don't vomit out a memorised essay.  Refrain from using absolute terms, like Always, never, etc. My teacher always says: QUALIFY, QUALIFY, QUALIFY.   Ensure that your paragraphs have different big ideas in them. For example, instead of just talking about plastic bottles polluting the seas, you might want to think big and talk about water pollution in general, which you  can branch out to discharge of chemicals by factories in rurual countries, etc.  As a JC1 student, you should start jotting down notes on current events in a notebook. These notes will come in handy when you need examples. You can start off with events that have occured this year in Singapore, ie Amos Yee, GE, City Harvest, Xi Jinping coming to SG, etc. Don't be limited to Singapore too. Foreign affairs are also very important. (Especially UK cos you want to suck some Cambridge cock).   Lastly, the usual advice. Practice, practice, practice. Try to do an essay outline every week, and a paper 2 every 2 weeks. If you have any questions, ask your teacher. Follow through dilligently, and you're sure to get at least a C for promos. (C is already very good in JC lol)| 1| 2015-11-01 09:31:04
singapore| mrmeowman| People still don't seem to realise that the best way to deal with shit you don't like, especially on social media, is to not click on it, don't talk about it, unfollow. Simple as that.   These social media influencers feed (literally and figuratively) off the attention you give them. By not giving them any attention, you simply starve them of any clicks, likes and page views that they can turn around and monetise.   Amos Yee wouldn't have become so notorious if we all collectively made the decision to ignore the kid and not flap up outrage around him.

His only mistake was to foolishly broadcast it when he knew how hard his country would crackdown on things like that.  I live in Malaysia, and we've had our share of similar figures. The "Sedition Act" is a common sword pointed at people who go "against the flow" in any way here. Anyone from YouTubers making anti-establishment parodies to opposition members who're getting just a *bit* too mouthy.  "Asian values" are also really excellent if you happen to be in power and want to stay that way. After all, "Asian values" dictate that you don't shake the boat, and that you respect your leaders, no? So what happens if you're the head of government and you're being investigated for corruption? [Why, you fire the attorney general investigating you, of course](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/7/28/malaysias-najib-razak-sacks-attorney-general.html). And what happens if your deputy suggests that you should disclose more info on your corruption case? [Why, you fire him as well, of course](http://www.wsj.com/articles/malaysias-najib-razak-shakes-up-cabinet-amid-1mdb-investigation-1438065854).   Edit: Because evidently, [you should value loyalty over smarts of any kind](http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/najib-i-value-loyal-people-over-smart-people). Man, I love living here, but it's just shameful what goes on higher up the ladder sometimes.| 17| 2015-10-18 05:11:51
singapore| iamaManBearPig| Interesting. The Amos Yee thing was shocking to me because of how similar to Western countries Singapore is on the outside, but then they seem to devalue things like individualism and freedom of speech when you look deeper.   I knew it had to do with cultural differences, but i thought the difference was due to ignorance(because who wants to suppress speech and individualism, right? /s). But i guess it really is just down to cultures valuing different things. | 13| 2015-10-18 03:20:00
singapore| hamsalamibacon| You know what truly pisses off Singaporeans? Amos Yee, HHH, Roy Ngerng, PJ Wong, etc etc. Loud-mouths who make a fool of themselves and get a heck load of vitriol in return. They might not deserve the level of hate thrown at them, but its an effective gauge of how much SGians hate such people. | 38| 2015-10-18 01:28:10
Brunei| jechan85| I think it is safe to say the 2 are much more freer than Brunei, but their level of freedom is far from the west. Amos Yee got detained, but look at him, he is freed now. If he was in Brunei, he may be detained indefinitely. In Brunei we also have our cases but they are mainly under-reported. Remember [Pg Hj Abd Rahman Pg Hj Omar](http://www.theborneopost.com/2013/06/08/bruneian-repents-for-views-against-islam/)?  In terms of freedom of expression and criticism against the government, Hong Kong is better than Singapore. They can go on protest, strike or even sue their government or their police. In Singapore it is much more restricted. We won't need to discuss about Brunei.   But in terms of democratic election, Singapore is better. All citizens of legal age have rights to vote equally. In Hong Kong they have 70 seats in the Legco. Only 35 are electable by public, the rest 35 are to be elected by a close circle of rich tycoons and pro-Beijing legislators. This made it unfair for the populace as a whole. In Brunei again we don't need to discuss about it.  The only truly free countries in Asia, according to this [index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index#Democracy_index_by_country_.282014.29), is Japan and South Korea.| 2| 2015-10-14 17:49:33
singapore| Quarkeey| I, fortunately or unfortunately, would rather not associate with Amos Yee.  Whilst I find he has some surface level points, his presentation as well as his oration are subpar in my opinion.  I do occasionally slip when writing, but usually my variation is sound and I do quick checks for redundancies before posting.  I must concede however that I am not in the best state of mind, and really should not be up at this hour.| -5| 2015-10-11 04:58:09

singapore| llosa| A question that I've always wanted to ask but didn't dare to set up another Amos Yee thread...  Who do you guys think is a 'good' dissident, if Amos is such a lousy one? Not trying to start an argument, just genuinely wondering what Singaporean's anti-government stance is actually approved of, since every high-profile 'activist' that I know of, like Roy, HHH, Amos, and Kenneth Jeyaratnam, has been lambasted both online and offline.| 2| 2015-10-05 14:38:52

If you had put that on YouTube, injected some vulgarity, and got it trending on Facebook, you'd be worshipped by the dissident crowd too.  That's what Amos Yee is. He's not some genius teenage revolutionary. He's a guy who happened to step into a perfect storm of social media.  And guess what. Every single country pulls the same nationalistic nonsense.

AdviceAnimals| Dreamwaltzer| &gt; I suspect that the oft claimed "no one has been prosecuted for being gay" sentiment is untrue.  Nar I don't think so. I think the government doesn't want to touch that problem. They will weasel around and get you on other laws which you may have inadvertently broken (case in point, Amos Yee)   IMHO, The government will never persecute two consenting guys having intercourse with each other. It will make them look too bad, and it will give the LGBT community  a martyr for their cause.  | 0| 2015-09-28 18:54:32
singapore| KaseyRyback| &gt; Singaporeans have never been famous for their tolerance. This isn't new. They don't make noise because they're either passive aggressive, or apathetic (just don't care). &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; Examples: Joo Chiat neighbors fighting, nerds fighting when queuing for iPhones, all the argument about cycling on pavement, entire nation captivated and held hostage by some NTUC employee, random Filipino, Amos Yee, Anton Casey, etc &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; I'm 35. I never remember a day when I thought Singaporeans are tolerant.  ah i see.  Maybe I take a big picture view of tolerance (i.e. the examples you listed are the kind I personally don't really care that much about) or perhaps my understanding of tolerance is different (or you might say wrong) but having been in other countries I'd say Singapore isn't too bad. Didn't intend for a long discussion so I'll leave it at that.  edit: after thinking about this, just for the record, I also want to ask: what's the difference between 'not caring' and 'tolerance'? What's the effective difference between a person who doesn't make noise because he/she is tolerant and because he/she doesn't care?  | 1| 2015-09-25 23:28:58

NeutralPolitics| Kazmarov| Don't want to make this a single monster comment so I'll tack on more here.  Singapore is an interesting society in that they have very little of what we'd traditionally call corruption- bribes, economic fraud. [Transparency International thinks very highly](https://www.transparency.org/country/#SGP) of Singapore. If you take a more holistic view of corruption though, it's a much darker picture.   The aforementioned gerrymandering is part of a system that has essentially no checks and balances. There is very little civil society- they Speaker's Corner, an idea lifted from the UK, is [often shut down and is tightly regulated](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/lee-kuan-yew-death-singapores-speakers-corner-shut-down-during-national-mourning-period-1493554) despite being one of the earliest symbols of free speech. Use of the courts as a hammer to silence dissent is very common. Amos Yee, a 16 year old who made a sweary condemnation of former PM Lee Kuan Yew when he died this year, was [arrested, tried, and sentenced to jail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Yee). Also nepotism- current PM is the son of Lee. | 1| 2015-09-25 17:13:57
singapore| llosa| I am his age and of his generation (obviously).   Also as a poet, I would like to give my 'humble opinion'.   It made me happy to see him writing poetry about Singapore. From an artistic POV, we need more Singaporeans making art about Singaporean themes, in our own Singlish language. Only then will Singapore develop culturally and socially. However skewed his perspective is, it's a lot more eloquently delivered than Amos Yee's caricature of LKY and Thatcher having anal sex. This is a good development, if more of our 'dissidents' (hey Roy, hey HHH) wrote poetry to express their views, we wouldn't be worrying about handicapped children getting heckled.  As for the poem itself - as a poem, it's not brilliant. It's repetitive, the rhymes don't really work, the rhythm is off. But does it have a purpose? Yes. Does it have a unique tone, like nothing I've ever read before? Yes. Is it delivered (as spoken word poetry) with passion and with commitment? Yes. I can see from the video that he has practised many times beforehand and that he has spent time crafting this poem to fit in as many stereotypes as possible. This was a carefully considered work. This is not the angry, immature rant that some people think it is.   If I could speak to Mr Lhu - because with his artistic effort he has earned the title 'Mr' - I would encourage him to explore the perspective of the 'rich kid'. In art, the black/white dichotomy is a disadvantage. It is a crippling weakness to paint the world while thinking of colours in only pure black and pure white. I would encourage him to add colour to his thoughts, to add subtle nuances, and to truly explore WHY the 'rich kid who complained' thought this way.  That is true art - distilling a cloudy mixture and ending up with clear, pure, strong truth.   Unfortunately, judging by his newfound popularity and the polemic comments on his Facebook feed, he will probably not go down this path. Like Amos Yee, like Roy Ngerng, he has discovered that the mob responds well to extremism. It is very easy to click 'Like' when someone says, "Fuck the PAP". It is very difficult to click 'Like' when someone says, "I do not agree with the PAP but I have considered their position...blah blah blah...and I think that we can work together for the good of Singapore." See what I mean? The first statement was punchy and it roused the blood of the misguided, angry generation I am a part of. The second statement bored you before I got to the first 'blah'. In our fast, result-oriented society, being snappy (at the expense of truth, which needs to be coaxed out in a slow and deliberate manner) is to the advantage of any rabble-rouser.   If Mr. Lhu read this, he would attack me for labelling him as part of the 'rabble'. He would say that the 'rabble' is 99% of Singapore. But Singapore is a country, not a pie chart. We are not split into 99% good guys and 1% evil thieving PAPper bastards. We are 100% Singaporeans. I hope that his future art can express this sentiment, because he is a powerful artist and I think that there is much potential for growth.   As Redditors, let's do our part by not attacking him based on his views. A man should never be attacked based on his views. As painful as this is to accept, there are no 'wrong' views. Yes, even Amos Yee has a correct perspective because he is entitled to his unique perspective. His fault lies in the execution and in the analysis of this perspective. I hope that if we continue encouraging Singaporean artists to create art that truly reflects the intelligence and sensitivity of Singaporean culture, we will someday create a Lord Byron or a John Steinbeck. Because poets and writers don't grow on trees. They are cultivated by a nurturing yet critical environment, and this environment is sorely lacking in Singapore. | 9| 2015-09-18 19:22:02
singapore| threesls| I have been told to use fewer clauses, yes. It's a thing.  An attempt at clarity: the Barrian thesis implies a trade-off: the swing electorate gives up certain political rights that it would like, for economic prosperity that it would like better. I'd like to suggest that this group actually fancies the political balance *and* the economic credibility of the post-move-left PAP. Like voters elsewhere in the developed world, not very much importance is placed upon the precise code of civil rights or fund disclosure policy - instead, voters perceive attitudes and credibility. Regulation of online media or suits against online personalities matters less than the party being perceived to be less arrogant, more apologetic for failures, and more relatable. Controlled liberalization of political and civil-social campaigning has eased the largest demands for political rights.  Because the party straddles both sides of assorted culture wars, it gets to play both the state that slaps around Amos Yee, and the state that slaps around the man that punched Amos Yee - it doesn't need to take sides inasmuch as be a credibly neutral and strong arbiter. It's not running as the Republicans or the Democrats, it's running as the Supreme Court, so to speak. Naturally some Republicans/Democrats will reject it as insufficiently partisan, but those people are not swing voters.  The government wins by default on economic policy because it can recite familiar conceptualizations of problems and proposed solutions: aging population, pioneer generation, skills upgrading, Singaporean core. Whole ministries, statutory bodies, NGOs, industry unions, and companies will have spent several years planning their own contributions. In contrast, non-WP opposition parties will tend to seize upon ideas that have mostly circulated in the opposition bubble. Ten days is not enough time to build a consensus over a minimum wage even amongst your own partisans, never mind swing voters. This strategy only backfires on the government if it gives everyone plenty of time to familiarize themselves with a policy they despise (cough population paper cough), but societal consensus means that the government will usually not to deviate very far from the center, even without explicit democratic input via parliamentary competition between representatives.  (putting aside some of Barr's other, related claims)| 2| 2015-09-18 17:46:47
singapore| onionguy4| &gt; The media is closely monitored and bridled”? No, the coverage of opposition rallies, election platforms, candidates and their arguments was more open and comprehensive than ever before.   That doesn't mean there aren't still a lot of boundaries or pushing the incumbent's agenda. For example keeping the spotlight on WP and ignoring SDP until it's groundswell looked like it was getting out of control. Carrying Shanmugams' remarks on Lim Ee Ping in a one-sided fashion. Not reporting that Punggol East had deficits as reported by certified accountants, etc.  In fact I would say opening the coverage of opposition rallies served the PAP's agenda in preventing a complete distrust of the mainstream media.  &gt; “Dissidents reasonably fear various legal and administrative punishments.”? No, Lee Kuan Yew is dead and the old fear factor has vanished.  This is the biggest joke in the wake of Leslie Chew, Amos Yee, and the fact that WP is treading (too) carefully in Parliament precisely because of this fear.| 1| 2015-09-16 04:34:54

AsianParentStories| belleberstinge| This is probably going to be a super-long post, but I think that it is well worth reading.  /u/jusventing I agreed that given your experience with Chinese people, making such a generalization had been reasonable. I'm going to comment on several replies you have given various people.  &gt; It's in their culture to work hard, so where are the results? Where are the Nobel Prizes, famous scientists, famous writers, academics and inventors? I know they work hard but they are like robots and because I was raised in this culture I have a right to criticise it and say it's stupid. Why do rich Asian countries have working hours so much longer than western countries just for the same salaries? Why are all their universities so shit? Why are all their university students both at home and in the west always plagiarising their work? Why can't they do ground breaking research or contribute much to the sciences?  Unfortunately, I cannot agree or support a sentiment that blames culture for these problems. There are many reasons why Chinese are not well-represented in certain fields that many Western-raised people recognize as successful and of high achievement.  &gt; Where are the Nobel Prizes, famous scientists, famous writers, academics and inventors?  It might be useful to ask an analogous question: why are African Nobel Prize winners underrepresented? Perhaps it is because comparatively speaking, in absolute numbers, few Africans receive formal instruction in scientific English, which is pretty much required in order to communicate with academic peers today. Perhaps Africans place less importance on marks of personal achievement, which may not be a bad thing altogether. These are all reasons that are not because of African culture. The best answer is that we don't really, definitively know.  As a counterpoint towards famous writers, I have a couple favorite East-Asian writers who I consider as Great as [Dead White European males](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_white_men), that you might be interested in reading :)  They just aren't very widely read in English as they are less relevant to Europeans, just like how Chinese won't really be able to appreciate Paradise Lost.  One of them is [Lu Xun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu_Xun). In a time when China was being humiliated by Western power, he did to Chinese Literature something similar what Dante did to Italian literature (of course, intelligently borrowing from Romantic authors in the European tradition). Lu Xun wrote in common Mandarin, writing stories about the common man. This was a time when people thought that everyday speech was not worth putting to words, only Classical Chinese --- much like how Europeans thought that it was only Latin, understood only by nobles with lots of time to spare on education, that deserved to be the language of letters. Of course Lu Xun used his writings to criticize the shitty parts of Confucian culture. The communists loved him, back when communism stood more for individual liberty of the masses against old monarchies and far-too-powerful capitalist barons rather than totalitarian state control as we perceive it today.  The other person is [Osami Dazai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osamu_Dazai), a Japanese author who lived through WWII. He lived through rapid change; before the war he was an aristocrat in oligarchic Meiji-era Japan. Meiji-era Japan was pretty Westernized, think WWI era Europe with gentry and nobility. Nevertheless the war and the period following the war brought about intense change in Japan. As the government changed, so did the values that its people lived by. Dazai's protagonists are often weak people confused and screwed through the sea change in cultural values. We empathize with them because we recognize that they did not deserve the suffering they experienced.    &gt; Why do rich Asian countries have working hours so much longer than western countries just for the same salaries?  In China's case, a very fundamental reason (among many others) is because it does not have as much technological capital as Western countries. The Great Leap Forward pretty much destroyed an entire generation of technological progress. With regard to the 4 Asian Tigers, it is, once again, a lack of technological and educational capital; they have not had the luxury of having universities and factories and industrial infrastructure for as long as had Western countries. (Why doesn't Africa have great universities?) Hence it takes more effort and more mistakes to profit from the production of goods as compared to Western countries. Yes, culture plays a part, but the culture had been shaped by economic realities.  &gt; Even with Singapore, the way that teenager Amos Yee was treated was quite disturbing to me, and reading what Singaporeans had to say about him on Reddit, YouTube and elsewhere just reaffirmed my views on many Chinese people. I just dislike people that are too easily offended, take themselves too seriously and are closed minded :/  I am very disturbed, too, by the public's reaction to Amos Yee. But I'm pleased by how the judiciary upheld the rule of law, and, in a sense, gave him a sentence for something they had to find him guilty of, taking into consideration legal precedents. The unfortunate thing is that there is only one city in Singapore, so rather than having each city have its own quirks, injustices, bigots and problems, every stupid city issue is a national issue and reflects on the national character. Imagine if Detroit and it's city's problems represented the entire US! Bigots have the loudest voices and least restraint, no matter where you go.  &gt; Why else do none of them have friends, why aren't any of them getting laid, why do they never go to parties or get invited anywhere?  &gt; This is my personal problem relating to my family.  &gt; I have enough people to like me to have a meaningful life, I just said I feel I might have inherited some Chinese personality traits that I dislike.  It seems like you're frustrated that you've had to change so many Chinese aspects of yourself in order to be treated how you want to be treated by your peers. I think you should keep in mind that for example, in a more East Asian context, you might be seen as flavors of obnoxious, aggressive, threatening, disrespectful and coercive due simply to your more expressive body language. It's simply a different set of communication norms, and it is not really meaningful to say which is the better. Many Westerners staying in East Asian countries struggle to have friends as well. Opposite to that, many people in this sub are struggling to integrate into a Western society holding contemporary Western values. You probably are too. Despite the pain we experience, it is insufficient evidence to say that Western culture &gt; East Asian culture. Everybody from a different culture will bring over elements from their native culture that makes it difficult for them to be respected and succeed in the foreign society they live in.  &gt; Funnily enough the only person living in Asia (Singapore) that contributed to this post actually agreed with much of my assessments of Chinese people and society.  (here's what I said)  &gt; I live in Singapore, and am ethnically Chinese, and comparatively speaking, I understand your observations to be true. &gt; My father himself harbors several cultural expectations of him and his role as a father that harms his happiness, his productivity and his ability to develop healthy relationships.  I mentioned comparatively speaking here. I should have included which observations I agreed with and to what degree. Personality is rarer. Social skills are often worse. Studying for the exam is common in East Asians, but the faux pas you can find examples of anywhere. Relationships seem more calculating to you, and that is called guanxi. The stable job mentality is true, but has its origins in the extreme want many experienced under Mao. In a society more tailored to Chinese mores, your family was the center of your life, and relationships outside your family were more businesslike. Chinese are more invested in their family members and regular family rituals like having dinner together to make them happy and so when things at home are in flux or seem to be not normal the tension is greater, which might explain your observations about jealousy and abuse. I cannot comment about the frequency of jealousy and abuse. Intellectual curiousity and studying for the exam are both related to the good job bit. I cannot agree with saying that Chinese suffer from Aspergers.  I've replied to many of your questions with explanations detailing how different aspects of being Chinese and growing up in Chinese culture lead to problems individuals face, and problems in society. **You have mentioned many problems Chinese face and taken them as evidence that Chinese culture is awful.** The easy way out is to blame it all on Chinese culture. This is like blaming a God/luck for problems that happen. It does NOT solve our problems or make us better people. That is why other people have called your perspective immature. In the case of Nobel Prizes and working hard, a person with a wider perspective might suspect Eurocentrism and latent racism as major factors. So that you do not potentially implicate yourself in cultural victim-blaming, and so that you do not misattribute the causes of complex problems to mere culture, it would be better to catch yourself when you want to blame Chinese culture as the origin of the problem you observe.  I'd also like you to ask yourself if you hate yourself for being half-Chinese because your peers are prejudiced against Chinese behaviors (hopefully not!). But if that is the case the worst thing you can do for yourself is to hate yourself because your peers are prejudiced against you.| 2| 2015-08-23 18:58:29

AsianParentStories| condor_gyros| Please point us to a post in which you substantiate any of your claims, instead of shifting the burden of proof onto your detractors. Sure, you can generalize. But, if you're going to attach labels to like boring, lack of interest in certain subjects, lacking in social skills, mean-spirited women, likelihood of being bipolar or having Asperger's, as if they were all matters of fact that apply to the entire ethnicity, then you'd better be able to back them up. At the very least, if what you say is true, then it shouldn't be too difficult to find data about the incidence of bipolar disorder, and Asperger syndrome, amongst Chinese, or Mongoloid populations, in general. The same can be said about subject area interests like politics, history, music, science, literature, and philosophy. Why should we just take your word for it?  /u/belleberstinge simply agreed with your observations about the interests and behavior of Chinese in general, not what these traits say about the ethnicity as a whole. I, too, am from Singapore, and have been fortunate enough to spend substantial periods of my life both there, and the US. Since you're just going with personal experiences, then all of the traits you have mentioned, I have been able to experience to varying degrees from all the ethnic groups with whom I've had the privilege to interact with. Some are more prevalent in the Chinese, some more so in Whites, Malays, Indians, Blacks, Koreans, South Americans, etc. In particular, I have experienced a couple of your mentioned traits more commonly in White Americans. Should I also cast a blanket statement about them as a whole?  With regards to Amos Yee, I do agree with you about his treatment. However, what does that have to do with the Chinese? Sure, Singapore may have a Chinese majority, but there are also sizable populations of Malays, Indians, Whites, etc. As far as I can tell, Amos Yee was, and still is, close to universally reviled there. Some simply don't like what he said; some agree with him, but question his motives, delivery, and the image he has cast on opposition political parties. To attribute his treatment to just the Chinese is disingenuous at best, and also trivializes all other ethnic groups in Singapore.| 2| 2015-08-23 01:38:46

AsianParentStories| JimJimmins| Are Singaporeans downvoting this comment here? Because of Amos Yee? Geez... You gotta admit that Amos Yee's punishment was way over the line. All 16-year-olds say subversive things. Plus knee-jerk reactions to criticism against LKY aka God of Singapore, don't help in showing that we Chinese are not a hivemind.  Plus, the dudes just speaking his mind...  Jusventing, I'm Chinese and I find that I share a lot of your emotional concerns regarding interacting with Chinese people. However, one needs to be able to distinguish between culture and genetics, and groups and individuals. Ethnicity doesn't define personality traits as strongly as upbringing. I won't disagree on your points regarding how some Chinese people behave. But do know that you aren't the only Chinese person feeling this way. And also that what you see on the surface about a person isn't the whole deal.  For now, just understand that there may be an unseen diversity amongst Chinese people. I for one am usually afraid to speak my mind about things. Because, you know, I live in a repressive Asian society. But I do give a shit about politics, race-relations, philosophy, mathematics (it's way deeper than one might assume) and other hoity-toity subjects that I'd never assume a fellow Chinese person would like. I do not know how many of such Chinese are out there. I'm not optimistic about it, but maybe one day, our Chineseness will not be an impediment to just being who we are.| 3| 2015-08-22 18:49:49
AsianParentStories| jusventing| I am fine with establishing good relationships with individual Chinese people (and have done so many times), but at the same time I also acknowledge that as a whole I am less likely to meet a Chinese person that I like compared to other ethnic groups. Their values and way of life are just really different from mine.   Even with Singapore, the way that teenager Amos Yee was treated was quite disturbing to me, and reading what Singaporeans had to say about him on Reddit, YouTube and elsewhere just reaffirmed my views on many Chinese people. I just dislike people that are too easily offended, take themselves too seriously and are closed minded :/   As a whole though, despite my prejudices I am not against meeting and making friends with Chinese people. My views on them as a people doesn't affect my views on certain individuals that so happen to be Chinese.| -3| 2015-08-22 09:40:36

Both will be charged, but assault is taken very seriously (see the man who slapped Amos Yee). It is unlikely that the racist guy will/can be charged as 'inciting racial tension' since his comments weren't on a public forum with the intention of trying to influence opinion etc. and even though he was clearly the agitator he will likely get less time.  I'm not explaining why very well, but since IANAL maybe someone else will be able to explain this better.| 7| 2015-08-21 04:23:52

explainlikeimfive| ShrimpCrackers| Ah yes a Chinese language copy of the Economist back in 2000 correct? Oh it wasn't? It was in English only?  Do you not realize that in China they don't care because only a tiny minority speaks and reads English anyway? And the educational system ingrains in every citizen that Western media is not to be trusted? How many can tell the difference between race, state, and government? Very few, this is why any attack on the Chinese government is met with either hostility or a brain is shut off.  Actually in Singapore there are semi-negative articles about Singapore. In fact they simply arrest people just like in China. Remember Amos Yee? They jailed a teenager for criticizing the government. In China one can criticize the Chinese government online. It will disappear over time, leaving people to wonder if it was their imagination or they misremembered.  If you could only read Chinese and participated, you'd realize that the government censors don't delete anything immediately, they wait and delete after everyone's vented so it can't build up. You don't have a backstory or a long list of grievances to build. Go to Baidu China and find a long list of the Szechuan Earthquake victims anger against the government or their protest against them and how they ended up getting arrested? What? No? OMG.| 3| 2015-08-20 03:22:02
ILiveIn| timothy558| The SG50 logo was abused to kingdom come, trending the hashtag #simisaisg50. The apparent rules were that you couldn't use it on illegal products...and that was it. Any and all services rehashed it until it became really worn out.   That's just the basics of it. The parade was huge, LKY (Rest in peace) "The Father of Modern Singapore" passed away not long before and the year just became really symbolic. And the discounts. Yes please. Add in Amos Yee, Unbelievable and all sorts of random nonsense and this year looks really exciting and fresh. The election is probably just the kicker to end SG50 too.  Also, the MRT broke down for the umpteempth time some days after, some major, some minor, but frequent enough that the current Transport Minister stepped down amongst all the backlash. But there were free rides on buses and trains on August 9th. You really feel like a king not tapping in.

indonesia| LinkentSphere| As a matter of fact, I have lived half of my life in SG and driven there for more than 10 years.  I couldnt see anything wrong with my English unless you had chosen not to understand them.   Do enlighten me with your superior English.  Coming to /r/Indonesia which mostly are non-daily English speaker.   I dont even know what the hell do you expect the level of the English speaker here.  Must have felt insecure on your level of English thus needing to compare it with someone who you hope to be worse than you.  On topic, Lets get a license to block off PIE/AYE for a day. I am sure you cant.  But in Indo, you could get literally get any license as long as you pay enough.  Seeing your post on Amos Yee, I could see that you are either him or someone who idolised him.  But I can tell you that, he is just an attention seeker. Couldnt get famous and did some infamous thing (Comparing Chinese New Year and Christian New Year) which is totally wrong interpretation.  And his speech on LKY are something that can be written by many in Hardwarezone forum but doesnt dare to speak out.  What he did is Stupidity, against the law and will be prosecuted.  What Anto did is Bravery, according to the law and may get mobbed by those Bikers.| 6| 2015-08-18 19:35:16

startrek| ctetc2007| Having recently moved to Singapore, I wish Star Trek was popular here. Very modernized place, but they have some pretty severe restrictions on free speech (imagine sedition charges for criticizing the government).   A few months ago, this 16 year old kid named Amos Yee posted a YouTube video criticizing Christianity and Lee Kuan Yew (Singapore's first prime minister, had just passed away). He got arrested and was charged for sedition and making religiously offensive statements. Ended up being convicted for the "intentionally offending Christians."  Human Rights Watch picked this up, and huge protests happened in Hong Kong, but if you look in /r/Singapore, you'll find the general sentiment that he deserves his conviction for being an asshole. You'll find responses like "These foreigners know nothing about the context of the situation" or "I don't give a fuck what Human Rights Watch thinks"  I really wish they'd watch a few episodes, especially The Drumhead, to knock some sense into them about liberty and how they support a system that erodes it away.| 2| 2015-08-15 23:14:22
atheism| icecreammachine| &gt; You have never read stories on here about places such as Uganda, Laos, or Pakistan?   I don't hang out on this sub. I'm still familiar with the countries.    &gt;I have been to Uganda. Your point? You don't have to go to a place to know it's not a good place to be.  Perhaps some more travel would open your mind.  &gt;You clearly haven't been listening to what I've been saying. Japan is civilized, as is most parts of China, as is Korea. I don't think those are western cultures are they. I also don't like Britain.  I have been listening. You're establish a pecking order of lesser races.   What country are you from and please tell me if you think that one is "civilized"  &gt;Which 50%?  Take a guess. I'm sure you can figure it out.   &gt;Because their industry, culture, and achievements have been recognized on a worldwide scale.  &gt;&gt;Why is Singapore only arguably civilized?  &gt;Their industry is good, but their government is corrupt and their culture is lacking. Just look at what happened to Amos Yee.  Lol. China is far more corrupt than Singapore. China is not nearly as developed as you're making it out to be in certain regards. It's getting there, but not yet.  &gt;Ask around. I'm not the arbiter of that. That falls into the realm of common opinion.  Bullshit. You make the claim, you back it up.  Realm of common opinion?  Um, no.  Most people who have a clue about the world wouldn't be spouting the shit you are.  &gt;Not so. Russia, Romania, and Singapore are developed countries, but I would hardly call them civilized.   And yet, you cite industry as a measure of being civilized.  Sonthat's why I ask you about Korea. Was SK civilized in 1955?  It had no industry.  Or was SK civilized in 1980?  It was extremely corrupt.  Allegations of corruption still fly today.  &gt;There's your problem. That's known as bias.   Ok. What are you on about?  Your whole rant is filled with bias and looking down your nose at other countries.  &gt;I'm not a racist. This might be projection on your part, though. I just present the facts. The facts might be racist, but if that's the case, then it's still not my fault. Just because a country is uncivilized doesn't mean that the people therein are inferior or as you put it, "lesser races."  Facts aren't racist.  Racism is an opinion or outlook. And the fact that you try to explain it away as facts being racist certainly shows that you are, in fact, racist.   &gt;though their people are very superior to many Chinese people I have met  Thank you for backing my points about racism.  &gt;Vietnam isn't very civilized  Please, tell me why not. And tell me why Russia isn't civilized (it has all the points that you love China for).  &gt;America is civilized, but most Southerners didn't accomplish that.   Thank you for showing your idiocy and complete lack of knowledge about a country that's probably the easiest to find information about. Any American will tell you that the South has contributed greatly to The US and made it what it is today.  &gt;Just like you did in this thread  Irrelevant, and I was right.

You clearly haven't been listening to what I've been saying. Japan is civilized, as is most parts of China, as is Korea. I don't think those are western cultures are they. I also don't like Britain.  &gt;You do realize 50% is very high, right?  Which 50%?  &gt;Sorry that you are completely ignorant about Korea.  Blame your country's statisticians. I'm just stating facts. I actually don't even like Korea, but I respect it for what it is. Compared to other Asian countries, Korea is decent.   &gt;It's ok to admit when you're wrong.  I have no problem admitting I'm wrong when I'm wrong, but I'm not wrong here.  &gt;explain what are the standards for "civilized Asia"  an advanced state of human society, in which a high level of culture, science, industry, and government has been reached.   &gt;Why is China civilized?   Because their industry, culture, and achievements have been recognized on a worldwide scale.   &gt;Why is Singapore only arguably civilized?  Their industry is good, but their government is corrupt and their culture is lacking. Just look at what happened to Amos Yee.  &gt;Why isn't Thailand civilized? Why not Vietnam. What about India?  Look at the state of those countries and tell me that you think that a place such as India is civilized. Indian culture is developed, when their rape rate is as developed as Africa. I'm sure many of those Indian women wouldn't share your sentiments.  &gt; Has Korea only been civilized for as long as its been developed?  Ask around. I'm not the arbiter of that. That falls into the realm of common opinion.  &gt;I think you're getting confused and are mixing "civilized" with "developed".  Not so. Russia, Romania, and Singapore are developed countries, but I would hardly call them civilized.   &gt;Actually, most people I know would.  &gt;Most people "I" know  There's your problem.

singapore| floppyfishy| Hi, I’m 18 too. Yeah the recent videos had me thinking. Quite a number of my friends are have a somewhat skewed perception of the PAP.  Here are the usual lament: SG education is too rigid, no room for creativity/arts, too much people too little land, COE too expensive, govt only want only want our money.  + points for decrying EVERY single thing that the government says as *propaganda*.   The sentiment among youths now is quite anti-authoritarian / pro-democracy. Take note that this isn't right or wrong, they're just ideologies. We were raised in an Americanized world so we're more inclined to democracy being the "best" system of governance. Free speech and liberalism are the tenets of a modern society. These are biases and not necessarily truths. But there are people who wish to martyr themselves for these ideologies and push for a neo-liberal progressive form of society. But they fail to see the context and its implications.   The sparks that fly when you bash against the establishment makes you seem brighter than you are. Those sparks also tend to offend. Amos Yee is spreading lots of sparks. Igniting untruths, being incendiary to many. Amos Yee is appealing to the taboo that is openly insulting the government. I won't say his stance is wrong. It’s just misinformed and ignorant of the realities and the context in Singapore. With another angle of approach and proper sources he can challenge the government in a much more constructive way.  In the recent national day sucks video he talks about excessive military spending and draws parallels with SG and Nazi Germany. You can see that he ignores the context yet again. We **NEED** a robust and well equipped military to act as a deterrence our neighbouring regions. **OF COURSE** we have not used our military in full force (which he suggested as a waste), I sure hope the day never comes. If you want a comparison, look an Israel instead – a city state in with a different ethnic majority from its surrounding region. It’s a big military spender as well.  [Interesting read on how our military would fare in a regional war](http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/27237)  Then he complains about the whole SG50 initiative. First we complain about the lack of culture and identity and now that money is pumped in into that then you say that it could be spent on healthcare instead? What you want the govt to do? SG healthcare system is already very robust and can take care of itself anyway.  You know what he’s doing? He’s just isolating events and applying his own twisted ideology to it. Chop it up, make it bit sized, and add a little of ribald humour and bam you get a controversial Amos Yee vid.  That concludes the first part of my message.  This part introduces my perspective on things and how could possibly view things in another manner.  To see why context is so important, we have look at our past.  Let’s go back to the 1960s. Let's also hold our all our biases against communism /democracy. PAP was contesting for the rule of Singapore. Communism was a strong ideology that was running in the Chinese population and backed by China. Anyway Lee Kuan Yew decided to step up, form a party, and contested to govern SG. He gave speeches to communities all around Singapore almost every day during the election period. He picked up Chinese and Hokkien to convince and gain the trust of Singaporeans. He gave a series of 12 talks on radio to educate the citizens on the merger. He made use of his passionate rhetoric to change the opinions of people and engaged them in active citizenry. I think that's the ideal democracy we're looking for? Constructive, genuine, unregulated and interactive speech. He won then.   So here comes the controversial part - Operation Coldstore. The communists had links to other groups Malaysia and they were honestly a threat to the nation. You want an armed communist threat in Singapore? A "fair and open" political environment also means giving space for communists to engage in their operations. Their ideology was SAID TO BE charged up. So yes, he decided to detain all of them without trial and deport them. That ensures the stability that we needed as a nascent country.  Let's say you stand for free speech and political liberalism. You let the communists stay. Contest you for the next GE. Spread their ideology and proclivity for violence. Singapore, with its Chinese majority, could be THE communist hub of SEA. Would it be better? You know what happened in Vietnam? It's all about ideas. Hell, other countries get involved too. The US will back the pro-democracy side, China will back the communists and there you go you got a civil war that will set us back an entire generation. That's what happened to Vietnam. I’m not saying that this definitely would happen, but the probability of it happening is pretty big.  So this is the importance of context.   But you see context can be **skewed** as well. The communists could have been a peaceful bunch.  *“The government certainly still says so. Just last year, it said the Barisan was "not an ordinary left-wing political party, and its leaders were not 'unwitting dupes' of the communists" but was planning "to use violent unconstitutional means to overthrow the government."*  *But former Barisan leader Dr Poh Soo Kai, among those arrested, insists this was not true.*  *"There may have been some communists in our party, but we were not following their orders. We did not want terrorism, we were committed to constitutional reform," the 83-year-old says.”*  [From BBC Article "Could Singapore have become communist?"](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-33621862)  [What if LKY never won?](http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/15489/production/_84677178_abf286e1-c646-4809-ba91-413ee32398f4.jpg)  So what is true? Who do you believe? Do you see how multidimensional our reality can be. Contrast this Amos’ monochromatic thinking.   What I believe after considering everything is that any communism would be a threat in SG and it was better if these elements were eradicated. Even if they were peaceful I wouldn’t want to risk it. Yes okay maybe he overreacted and detained them. But he was doing what he felt was best for Singapore at that time.   He did what thought was needed for Singapore, and it was based on reality not just a political fantasy of his. He had a clear vision, was able to alter the circumstances to ensure that his plan was carried out. Yes you can argue that once LKY got power he used (or abused) his power to clamp down on communists, set up harsh laws, regulate the media, supress opposition. But this was all for a stable political climate and ensure safety and prosperity of all of us.  And about opposition…I really don’t know what to say. I don’t think we have a credible opposition that is able to stand up against PAP. Always wondered why a group of intelligentsia don’t form up and present a sustainable alternative for governance. (ok maybe it isn’t that easy)  LKY did say that all he wanted was the best for SG and he would gladly welcome any opposition that was better than PAP to take over. He even mused about splitting PAP into 2 parties for the sake of opposition (something like right / left wing I guess). But what’s the point right? Talents, good people from both sides would then lose seats in parliament. Not like SG has many people who can take up the mantle of leadership. So now the govt vacuums talent (by talent I mean GOOD and SMART people) and recruits them into PAP. I don’t see the problem of paying them more too, especially if they can earn much more in private sector and not come under so much public scrutiny.  LKY’s post-independence survivalist mentality have pushed pragmatism and a sedate political scene in our society. That served us well for quite some time, but now it’s time to move on. I’m sure PAP knows it too.   So that was **my view**. Don’t simply take it. Think about it, play with it. I totally agree with what Apparatus404 was saying.  If you want to get a perspective from the man himself, do grab LKY’s memoirs and the hard truths. Trust me they’re really quite readable and very interesting.    | 15| 2015-08-09 00:08:36
singapore| Bugisman3| What do you really mean by pro-Singapore? I call myself pro-Singapore even if I don't like the state of politics there and live overseas. I am however proud of our food and support our national teams and enjoy the company of other Singaporeans while overseas.  For the past 6 years I've been following the Reform Party and KJ, due to the legacy of his father. However I'm a bit disappointed that he signed up Amos Yee.  I didn't mind that he was siding with AY during the case and after the outcome, but I was a bit cringed by the actions of AY baiting the government and PAP supporters. I mean I empathised with him about being heavily sued by someone who is barely damaged by him but sometimes AY looked like he kept pushing the wrong buttons and exposed himself to it. That being said, I think he should get counseling.  He is rather intelligent and saw politics for what it is but he didn't play it smart.| 1| 2015-08-08 21:55:19
singapore| lee_guan_you| Amos Yee isn't fascinating at all, it's the reaction of Singaporeans to his antics that provides far more food for thought.| 22| 2015-08-08 19:17:59
singapore| ValuablePie| Talking bout all that inciting political stuff doesn't make Amos Yee. Being able to linguistically analyse Singlish with very impressive accuracy and insight at the age of 15 does, though. | 5| 2015-08-08 18:33:36
singapore| Azuredrak| Why do you care about what kind of person he is? You are confused over whether Singapore is a good place or not, not about whether Amos Yee is a good man. A good man can spout nonsense at times, so can a terrible man, you look at the facts and assess matters in your own way, Amos Yee is a non-factor here. Discard him from your mind and look at the world through your own eyes.  Objectively speaking, Singapore is a pretty good place compared to the rest of the world. It has some flaws, as do any other countries in the world, that's a fact, you cannot deny it. As for whether Singapore is good **for you**, that'll depend on what you value. What makes a good place, and what makes a bad place? There are things that Singapore is better at, there are things it is not as great at when compared to some countries.  To put things into perspective, you need to remember that other places, just as Singapore do, have "average, middle-class people - those who live in ordinary flats, go to ordinary schools and have average-pay jobs." No country is completely free of issues, the key here is, how much issues, and do these issues matter to you? If you look at what other countries have and you feel that they are important to you, then by all means pursue them, follow your true feelings. No country is perfect, it's all about which suits you more.  Nobody here is responsible for telling you what you should like. You are the one making the decision. Always consider both the good and the bad. Bear the consequences of your decisions, remember, nobody owes you anything, vice versa.| 6| 2015-08-08 17:56:35
singapore| ginger_beer_m| +1 this.. Amos Yee (and a lot of other teenage Singaporeans) should travel more, at least within Asia, just to get a perspective how Singapore stands in comparison to the rest. | 4| 2015-08-08 16:32:34
singapore| Apparatus404| I don't like talking about Amos Yee. And I do not want to talk about him. But he appears again and again. As far as I'm concerned, he's just a vocal teenager with a youtube account who people have been over reacting to. His opinions are generally absolutely normal and popular even. Especially among angry teenagers. It isn't new. It isn't special. It isn't insightful. He's good at speaking and citing random big names to make it sound like he knows what he's saying.  But he is incredibly short sighted, like a lot of angry teenagers.  So I'm not going to talk about Amos Yee, I'm going to talk about larger problem that both he and people who listen to him fall into.  Singapore is not black and white. No one is truly evil, and no one is truly good. Singapore isn't the greatest place to live in and it also isn't the worst place to live. Calling society brainwashed and speaking like the "brainwashed" can't reason for themselves and see beyond what SG50 is, is also incredibly black and white.   Speaking against SG50 and LKY doesn't automatically make you super smart, edgy or ungrateful. Speaking for SG 50 and seeing that LKY has done some good things, and loving being here, isn't you being brainwashed.  Do you see how my statements have accomplished nothing other than to state that everything is grey? Because everything IS grey. A lot of younger people, and older people fall into the black and white mentality, and fail to see Singapore and People as how they truly are.  I'm not trying to give you an opinion on what you should think about Singapore. Or what you should think about SG50. I want you to think about how to think critically. How to see the bigger picture. How to understand humanity and how the world works. Put yourself in different shoes. Pretend you're running the country and see how it works. Look at the news and see how actual people react. And see the various types of reactions, and try to understand the reasoning behind them.  An older generation person might be happy with LKY. Why? Don't immediately yell BRAINWASHED! Because then that'll be refusing to understand what's happening. Maybe they had a more personal account. Maybe some of LKY's policies actually benefited them. Maybe they have a similar philosophy.  .. and maybe they're actually mindlessly following someone else. But then figure out why they're midlessly following ideas.   And then you could have someone else be an absolute LKY hater. And you don't have to yell UNGRATEFUL. That's still not understanding why a person would dislike him. Maybe policies that benefited the earlier example, made life worse for this guy. Maybe he has personal reasons.  .. maybe he's also blindly following someone else who hated LKY. But then you have to figure out why they mindlessly followed that train of thought. What is their philosophy in life like?  And even then, What other examples of political figures can you find? Political figures from other countries. You'll find very similar reactions to them in a bigger scale. So now you know these things are unique to singapore. So is this a Singapore problem or  a human problem?   **EDIT: [Fine. Here's an article about public figure deaths. You'll see how the way people reacted to LKY's death isn't unique to Singapore. AT ALL.](http://www.salon.com/2011/12/17/christohper_hitchens_and_the_protocol_for_public_figure_deaths/)**  People who speak in absolutes, and black and white. People who use catchy terms like Brainwashed, The masses, Anarchist and all that fail to see how the world works at a whole. Go travelling, go try and find out how other countries work. Discover other cultures. You'll see that some things are human problems and aren't specific to Singapore.  Over spending on a parade? Say hello to every national parade in every country ever. What about the royal wedding?  You can then argue that this isn't a good practice for humans to do at all and just because other countries do it, it doesn't mean singapore has to do the same. Sure. That would be right. Then we can wonder why humans do it. Why do so many people spend on parades? You can at least tell that this definitely isn't a Singapore Government conspiracy. And it's a larger problem, or maybe not as a whole.  I'm not giving you any concrete opinions. As I think the bigger problem we have here is being able to think for yourselves, and knowing that the world is grey.  Ok fine. I'll give you a quick opinion that has little to do with the government. A different view of SG50.  I like Sg50. It's annoying as hell. But I think it's necessary because Singapore lacks patriotism and most of the time people don't feel like they live in a proper country. You don't get the love people get for when they live in America, or Japan, or Australia. So if SG50 can keep people be incredibly aware that they live in a country that isn't all that terrible. Why not?  The funds for SG50 may or may not be overdoing it. But the funds for SG50 have been keeping some media companies afloat. In the past it was really difficult to come up with anything Singapore related in terms of media. But because of SG50, everyone is trying to one up each other. And now you've got very interesting takes on Singapore in the media.  Which is important because Singapore has been lacking a lot in terms of culture. Singapore has technology and businesses up, but the arts have been falling behind. We always say that Singapore doesn't have a culture. But SG50 has helped upped that a little bit as everyone has to think about how to represent Singapore now. Anything creative related to Singapore used to be really boring and sterile. It's always the same shit over and over again, like "I love all races" or "Vanda Miss Joaquim" or something.  But now we've got people drawing the merlion vomitting with the aid of Singa.  This sort of modern idea of what "Singapore" is, would help the country grow, culturally. It helps the country in the long run. Many people don't see the arts and media as important to a country. But I do. How far will this effect go? Will people immediately forget all the SG50 stuff after this year? I don't know.  Would you call this brainwashing? Maybe? Maybe not?  Do you see how this opinion about SG50 has very little to do with the regular THE GOVERNMENT IS EVIL or THE GOVERNMENT IS GOOD. It's just seeing how a policy, could potentially affect people and whether it may or may not do good culturally. There are many ways to view an event.   Because the government isn't one person. The government body is made up of many people. The different branches of government is made up of even more people just trying to do their jobs. Some might be dicks, and terrible, but some might honestly be trying to do their best.  Singapore has a lot of problems. SG50 to me, is not one of them.  I generally like to pretend that I have to run the country. Like what would you do different?  I actually do have some strong opinions about the government and society. Some Negative, Some Positive. But I've already written an incredibly long and incoherent terrible essay here. So... I'm tired and have already wasted too much time procrastinating on the internet.  So what I'm saying is. If you want to think objectively, and be incredibly neutral. Do not listen to just one guy, or any overly biased sources. Don't even just read news from Singapore based sources. Get out there. Learn about other countries, learn about other people. Learn about local policies, and global policies. And learn about humanity and philosophy. Learn as much as you can.  From there you can form you own opinions about things.  You are not just a person who lives in Singapore. You live in this world. Learning about the world will give you a better perspective of things here.  Edit: I wrote word vomit and then disappeared for a day, and came back to reddit gold. What! Thank you whoever gilded this post. | 201| 2015-08-08 15:06:49
singapore| kkyz13| You need a strong line of logic to actually make sense, which from the limited videos I watched of Yee, isn't that great.  I watch those you mentioned regularly, at least they carry some logical weight behind some of their rants. Amos Yee in comparison is a screeching chimpanzee.| 7| 2015-08-08 14:25:51
singapore| piptheboy| Knowledge is easily acquirable, but it takes wisdom/experience to use it in a meaningful and constructive manner. This applies to any field, anywhere. I actually agree with some of his points. Heck, I am sure many of us do; especially on how SG50 is being overdone, and how we are going rather overboard with the LKY references.   However, identifying problems and issues is entirely different from 1) admitting that you are partly to blame for it, and 2) working your brains to make a change. A baby can cry over spilt milk - but it takes an adult to clean everything up.   I learnt this after going through NS and entering the working arena. It does not matter how correct or spot-on you are. What will you do with that information?   Some will start pointing fingers and say, "See, I told you I was right. If only it had been done in another way...this wouldn't have happened."  Others will go, "Why the hell are things like that now? Can someone fix it NOW? This is ridiculous! This is an outrageous violation of human rights!!"  You will find whistle-blowers in every part of the world. I see so many angmohs and random people from other parts of the world supporting his video on YouTube. Fellow Singaporeans get downvoted, and we start doubting the way we do things.  Honestly, it does not matter whether you're the white 'master race', or part of the umbrella revolution. Whistle-blowers will always complain that things are suboptimal, and demand that there be change. They are always trying to find something or someone to blame (other than themselves). Unless something is done, they're gonna strike, riot and occupy some part of the city. Well, at least till their parents start to grab them by their hoodies and [smack some sense into them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tXSmCXZAuQ).   If there's anything useful I picked up from the National Education messages, it is that **nobody owes Singapore a living.** I.e. the world doesn't owe you shit (in teenager terms). You may pay your taxes, but it does not mean that the cleaner aunty has to clean up the crap you smear on the wall, nor does it mean that if you're right about something the world has to make it up to you and apologize. This is a nasty place which will beat you to your knees even if you have done nothing wrong - worse, even if you've done good deeds all your life. And in this nasty world, I'm glad I'm in the prettiest part - Singapore. I don't mind the splotches.   Look. Politics and the management of a country, in general, is a blackbox. There are no definite solutions to problems in societies. There was no perfect society in the world, not before, not now, not ever. My worry for Singapore is that there are too many whistle-blowers and too few problem-solvers like PM Lee. I respect that Roy Ngerng wants to try to run for elections, because he is trying to make a difference in his own, albeit controversial, ways. At least he is trying.   Amos Yee, however, is just another angsty teenager pointing fingers and complaining that his bedtime milk has gone cold. Someone give him a cookie please.   | 27| 2015-08-08 14:04:48
singapore| kkyz13| While I like Amos Yee for being the one of the few who is openly critical, an atheist and how Singapore could be better, he's also a representation of how a lot of us are in dealing with such topics; hostilely immature, almost below an amateur level of proper discourse.   From the lack of practice of actual discussion I would say, but its embarrassing to see that the most visible debater Singapore could muster is a Youtube troll.| 19| 2015-08-08 13:47:00

singapore| Dreamwaltzer| It has been ~~-17-~~ 0 hours since we last had a thread on Amos Yee.   You're a bit late to the philosophical ramblings on Amos Yee. When he first made the LKY video, we were getting many thread and blog posts basically asking the same question you are asking now. Which is why it became a joke to start the above counter.   That aside, a lot of people agree that Amos Yee is very dislike able. Regardless of the validity of his points, the manner of how he puts them forth annoys people.   But the thing is, Amos never intended to be an activist or anything like that. He just wanted to post his views on stuff. It's not an call to action or anything like that, it's just a video where he goes: I think this, I think that. And yet the Singaporean population is too sensitive and got the courts to throw him in jail, for unrelated issues. Just to teach him a lesson or something.   I don't like Amos Yee. But I don't like what our justice system did to him, and I think it's admirable how he fights it. I just wish he was less obnoxious. And had a less punch able face. | 31| 2015-08-08 12:48:25

singapore| llosa| Walao eh, what a shit day.  So basically my school is trying to suspend me because I haven't been attending enough 'house' sessions. I've played every card in the book - gone to sign in at the office, gotten a psychologist's letter, and tons of MCs to avoid going to house (free to see a doctor where I live).   Right now I'm just angry and frustrated (I only have 8 more weeks of school) and I refuse to go to house because well, I've got better things to do and I simply don't believe in it. Well, you can always make the point that 'in life you must learn to do things you don't like', but I see this as a form of conscientious objection. Call me Amos Yee or just a retard, but I believe that the mark of a mature adult is being able to choose what situations you are comfortable with.  So people will say, now that you've made your stand, you have to deal with the consequences. I suppose I am ready, I mean I don't really see them doing anything permanent because the bureaucracy is all about tai chi.   Sometimes you just need to scream out KNN! though. | 2| 2015-08-07 12:02:22

KotakuInAction| perriwing| Unfortunately, people love to overgeneralise and love being right.   When that happens, they prefer to lump a group together and label them the hellspawn of Satan or something. When challenged, they get aggressive / defensive.  I think a really good example was the case of Amos Yee in Singapore. I have little faith in people when I see adults gang up on a teen.  And have you ever had to deal with SJWs? Or perhaps you have an inside view on why journalists prefer to support them without much prior research?  For example, the targeted hate towards the folks at WizardChan or GamerGate supporters?| 2| 2015-07-29 10:57:16

changemyview| kojuntan| &gt;Signapore, being a city state, doesn't have to balance and micromanage as many different types of economic interests/complaints/grievances as the US.   I beg to differ on this point as my government is seen both by its own citizens and people from other countries as a government that likes to micromanage everything form the family unit to something to insignificant and i quote National Geographic Magazine '' Some people joke that the government micromanages the details of life right down to how well Singapore Airlines flight attendants fill out their batik-patterned dresses.'' . However i also do understand that Singapore being a extremely small state as compared to the US do not have to deal with as much issues as the US. This micromanagement has its benefits as it has created an ideal singapore whereby its people live in social harmony and economic prosperity as envisioned by the Late Mr Lee kuan Yew, known fondly by singaporeans as the Founding Father of Singapore.   http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/2010/01/singapore/jacobson-text  &gt;Furthermore, its small enough to where anyone who is that discontent with the state of affairs can do so without excessively undue hardship  Correct me if i am wrong but i assume that you are trying to say that anyone who is unhappy with the current system is able to voice their unhappiness of it and face no retaliation.   If that was what you have meant, i find it sad to say that this is very untrue as there are many cases whereby individuals from a 16year old ( amos yee) to even newspapers such as the New York Times and the Economist were sued by the Singapore Government after posting views that were deemed to be defaming the government. All of them had to either pay a fine,go to jail or in the case of NYT and Economist issue an apology to the government. The retaliation by the government has always been very effective in crushing any dissidents that they view might undermine the authority of the Government. This is very important to the government as they believe that an effective government is only possible if they have the support of its people. That being said personally i do not agree with their actions as i feel that sometimes  the problems in Singapore brought up by these ''dissidents'' are actually valid albeit without sufficient evidence to back them up.   http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/amos-yee-given-4-week/1963292.html (amos yee)  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/25/new-york-times-pays-singa_n_512761.html (new york times)  &gt;Which is probably why people are so complacent to military rule, since, if I'm not mistaken, a significant portion of Singapore's workforce and population are immigrants who knew and accepted what they signed up for when they entered the country, and those born to immigrants, who have incorporated this acceptance into their own cultural identity.  Wouldn't a military rule be like Thailand or Cambodia for instance, to apply it to singapore would be extrememly unfair after all its citizens do still vote for their government even if the government is a one party rule. However if you are trying to say that the government rules with heavy handedness like the military using a top down approach that would be a totally different case.   By accepting what they signed up for what do you mean? To lose basic human right? If that is the case then, yes. There are expats who come to Singapore to work that have to censor their own views and be careful of what they say and do lest they get sued for trying to disrupt social harmony. However,i believe that there is not a single perfect system that can ensure that everyone is happy and that there is no conflict be it social or otherwise. Although my government likes to view their way of governance as one of the best in the world, the Singapore way of governance is not perfect and still has its many flaws. Furthermore when foreigners come to SG most of them are here to work and make a living so as to let them families in their home country have a better life. i believe that their priorities would be to ensure their basic survival and the  restrictions that are imposed upon them in terms of freedom of speech are just afterthoughts for when they are able to make a good living here.  In addition some might argue that Sg govt still ''discriminates'' the LGBT community and as such some foreigners feel uncomfortable living here . However one must also understand that Singapore culture is  one that is still predominately conservative  despite us being more open as of late with Pink Dot movement that supports the LGBT community in SG. There is still the penal code 377A that criminalizes the mutual sex between men. This has caused some expats and people from overseas to decide not to come to SG which does hurt the economy in a way as we lose much needed talent. That being said the Prime Minister himself have said that even though the penal code exists there is no prosecution by the government if one decides to do so in private. However he has also said that SG people are by and large still not ready to accept same sex marriage despite it now being legal in US.  http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/spore-not-ready-same-sex-marriage-pm-lee   | 0| 2015-07-16 15:06:32
changemyview| kojuntan| Lets just clarify that I am not for  for the loss of any human rights but my government is the one that has deemed it necessary to take them away. I am just trying to rationalise their reasons for doing so.   So you might say that well, if you think that your government is not doing the right thing you should go protest and simply vote them out right?   Easier said than done, want protest? It is useless as nth can be changed unless you are the one in power which is alsi impossible.   Want to vote the ruling party out? Impossible, the opposition party leader has stated that they do not plan to become the ruling party.   So tell me how are we suppose to change how the government rule the country unless a large majority stand up to the govt and force them to change? People in SG all "kia si" which means scared to die, not literally but figuratively, so they are afraid of standing up to the govt becoz they knw that changing a govt is too risky a move to take and opposing them will only lead to your own downfall. Look at the Lawsuits roy ngerg, and the 16yr old amos yee have. Hell my govt even sued the Economist for an article they wrote.  I do not agree with my govt actions but I understand the reasons why they do it.| 1| 2015-07-16 02:30:08

worldnews| cloudmist| Feel free to look down on the people who reported him and locked him up. They do not represent Singapore or Singaporeans as a whole. They were just some butthurt people who took the video/blogposts way too seriously and felt personally offended.   Like I said, I don't agree with the sentence or his treatment.   Regarding this freedom of speech thing, it's honestly quite interesting cause I know that I can say whatever I want and not be afraid of being arrested and charged. But this obviously wasn't the case for Amos Yee. I guess some Singaporeans have a low tolerance towards jackasses. So yeah, you can look down on us for that much. 'Shame Singaporeans for not being tolerant of jackasses'.   Thankfully Singapore doesn't have too many jackasses so for 99.9% of Singaporeans they have the freedom to say whatever they want to.| 2| 2015-07-08 11:36:21

worldnews| ghenshaw| Yes. I think most people understand that laws and legal systems in all countries are works in progress. They are built to hold complicated groups of people that make up society together. There are complexities arising from race, historical injustices, class, and the like.  There is no legal system that is close to perfect on this planet.   However, you say, "freedom of expression does not mean freedom from accountability to society." Freedom of expression means that the government cannot make laws that criminalize speech.  When you say, "free speech must always be practiced responsibly" you are missing the point of free speech. Of course you cannot yell "FIRE!" in a crowded theater, people will be physically hurt. But the kind of speech that Amos Yee was engaged in should be protected in a society that claims to have free speech.  Let's be honest here. Clearly, at this time, Singapore does not have a society where its people can freely express themselves. Well, there are many other countries that, despite having freedom of expression, have many other problems that need to be worked on. I live in the US our legal system is essentially racist. Hmm, would you have felt comfortable making a statement like that about Singapore? The only way a problem can be addressed is to bring it to light through free speech. We're all in this together. Boundaries between countries are just fake lines drawn long ago by people who had no idea of the revolution in communication that was on its way.  | 2| 2015-07-07 21:05:08
singapore| Dreamwaltzer| it has been ~~-3-~~ 0 hours since we last had a thread on Amos Yee.  I feel most people don't understand the context of this smarmy little fuck and why he deserves what he gets. They read a news report and take things out of context. "oh its terrible, they threw a kid in jail".  Well yeah. Only because he kept breaking bail, and did not want to accept any bargains.

worldnews| JeraldTan| Hey Reddit, Singaporean here. I understand that many of you might think that this ruling is really unfair in the modern-day context. But I do hope that you guys realise that Singapore's culture is still one that is largely conservative (though that's changing with more youths being more willing to speak up). Thus, there would always be a sort of conflict between the conservatives and liberals here.   Furthermore, I believe that it is fair to say that the legal system here is still largely leaning towards more conservative values of Asian society. Also, Singapore past, having been rocked by racial and religious riots, has made the ruling government (the PAP) very sensitive to harmful, or particularly offensive racial and religious remarks.   I would agree that Amos Yee had some validity in his statements, but perhaps his comments were insensitive to the social context and norms of Singaporean society, and laws, thus, leading to his sentence. Even as the larger western world sees this as Singapore being unable to accommodate true freedom of expression, one must consider the fragility of the social fabric of Singapore. One so preciously put together, amongst different ethnicities and religions with no common heritage, and hence, worth protecting, even if some extent of free speech is compromised. Call this authoritarian or conservative, but I think free speech must always be practised responsibly, freedom of expression does not mean freedom from accountability to society.| 2| 2015-07-07 17:26:09
worldnews| Eladriol| How convenient that criticizing the government is equivalent to being an asshole.  &gt;Amos Yee was unremorseful for his actions and measures had to be taken a step further.   The horror, his opinion, which differed from societies no less, was not renounced!  You can base your society around conformity, comfort and never hearing a dissenting opinion if you want I suppose. Just don't be surprised when you still have a dictatorship by the end of the century and have no culture or technological advancements to speak off, only borrowed from others.   You know what, lets say the kid was entirely wrong, he's just stupid as well as rude about the government- The ex president was amazing and never did anything wrong; he is actually the god figure you guys make him out to be.   Even then you still should allow the kid to make criticism, because maybe in a few years you'll have a leader who isn't so wonderful and amazing... but you can't criticize him or get rid of him because you'll have a culture of servitude and deference to power, conformity and valuing form over substance. Maybe you'll stand up and say that you don't think the leader is right... but no one will listen to you because you'll be thrown in jail until you conform to the government.| 3| 2015-07-07 17:00:01
worldnews| CyberDonkey| As a Singaporean, I can assure you that you absolutely don't get it. We're not jailing him for what he said. We're just a pissed off nation that's angry about his actions **and** behaviour. He's arrogant and insensitive and an overconfident asshole. If his case had NEVER attracted wide attention, he probably would've never even been arrested in the first place, or at most only given a slap on the wrist.  He's just a problem child that's being punished for being an asshole. To me, you Americans have a warped sense of free speech where you believe that your rights gives you a free pass to be an asshole. That's not our culture here in Singapore. We have so many numerous laws that you guys poke fun at, but living here I assure you that local law only follows a general rule of thumb: don't be an asshole and nobody will look at you twice.  We're not an uncivilised third world country beheading a kid for youthful stupidity, we're giving a young adult 4 weeks in jail for his negative actions and behaviour as a lesson to him. The real punishment isn't the 4 weeks in jail, it's his criminal record that's going to live with him for the rest of his life. 4 weeks in jail is insignificant in the grand scheme of things. The kid isn't going to be tortured or caned in prison (unless he's sentenced to caning that I have not heard of). Mostly everyone in Singapore knows Amos Yee's case and everyone I know agrees that he's an asshole. Jailing him is more so a lesson than a punishment. You don't allow your kids to be mean and rude to other kids. You scold them and tell them that what they did was wrong. Amos Yee was unremorseful for his actions and measures had to be taken a step further.| 0| 2015-07-07 16:39:51
singapore| bluppy| That whole post really infuriates me. It's not like we're an uncivilised third world country executing a kid for being stupid, we're simply punishing a guy for pissing everyone off. 4 weeks in jail might seem harsh but in the whole picture of things, he didn't really lost any significant portion of his life. The real punishment is the record he now has, which I highly believe is deserved for his arrogance and insensitivity.  People are comparing us to North Korea when in reality I'm actually more afraid to live in America than I am over here. If the cost of living in Singapore was much lower, I'd even call this place a paradise. You hear all kinds of bad things living in America like student loans and expensive healthcare and corrupted government whereas education in Singapore is highly subsidised and greatly affordable for everyone. Healthcare can be expensive but it's also still affordable. I can never know how corrupted government officials can be in any country, but even if there are any in Singapore, it's definitely not to the point where we can feel the effects of their corruption.  Even young ladies walking alone at night in **any** dark alley in Singapore wearing skimpy clothing probably wouldn't even feel scared. Crime does happen in Singapore, nobody would deny that, but it's on the scale where we still do not need to worry much about it. Whereas there's so much news about gun violence or dangerous cops even in the good neighbourhoods of the US. The fact that a distinction between good and bad neighbourhoods even exists is worrying.  You can come to Singapore with 0 knowledge about the place and you can do mostly anything you want wherever you want granted you have the $$$. Go to the US and you have to do research about where you're visiting and common scams and tourist traps found there. Seems to me like Singapore more fittingly embodies the phrase "land of the free".  It's not like Singapore's numerous laws require a profound understanding if you wish to visit or even live here. A general rule of thumb is just don't be an asshole or do asshole things and nobody will look at you twice. I think that's pretty much true worldwide and not just in Singapore, but it's something Amos Yee doesn't grasp the concept of and is something people in /r/worldnews greatly disagree with because they hold the mindset that "free speech" is a free pass to be an asshole.  /rant| 14| 2015-07-07 16:05:29
worldnews| dasaher| I'm not sure if you misunderstood my comment. I was in no way comparing Amos Yee to the perpetrators of the Charlie Hebdo incident, but rather saying that crazies may get offended by what Amos Yee, or for that matter, anyone insulting their belief/race is saying and go around killing people.  Also by legally punishing people for being downright insulting to others' beliefs, we effectively reduce the incidents of a loudmouth kid as well as people who want to mass murder because they are offended.  I'm not sure whether using someone to intentionally offend crazies and luring them out is a good idea. I highly doubt our surveillance system is flawless enough to detect potential terrorists and mass murderers before, for example, the kid's apartment get burnt down or the trains get blown up. That's a good way to drive investors away from the country when a single oversight happens on the part of the surveillance personnel, and I'd rather not take the risk.| 1| 2015-07-07 15:37:02

worldnews| 903124| I live in Hong Kong where was developing very rapidly under British rule, and very little democracy is given in 70s and 80s.  I think you heard of umbrella movement is, and AFAIK the reason behind this is that Hong Kong people don't have a good way to regulate government especially  for their dumb decisions. For example Chief Executive of Hong Kong reject a new media network to get their licence to broadcast so Hong Kong people still have to withstand TV media monopoly.  Every government will do some wrong things and democracy instead of "Benevolent dictatorships" can help to prevent or recover the mistake. In Amos Yee case rather we say it is dictatorship I would rather say it is excessive use of government and judicial power which do not benefit the society.| 0| 2015-07-07 13:48:02
singapore| lenovo_using| Correct me if I am wrong. But there are only a handful of sensitive stuff you don't get to speak about in Singapore. Otherwise, freedom of express is everywhere. Especially in social media. On a daily basis, tons of site are condemning the G and the Lees.   Anyway, I find the AGC statement on Amos Yee very much sums up Singapore's stand on free speech. Here is the excerpt   At the outset, it is critical to reiterate what this case is about. It is most certainly not about the freedom of speech and the diversity of views. It is about the abuse of these freedoms. Unbridled speech without limits does not exist in any known society. Each society defines its own values and protects them. Religious harmony remains a key value in our society. So too is public decency. Under our laws, lines are drawn against acts that deliberately wound religious feelings and against the publication of images that have a tendency to deprave and corrupt. Amos Yee crossed those lines withcdeliberation and calculation. His actions led to his conviction.| -2| 2015-07-07 13:25:49

worldnews| heckados| Damn it why did this have to be here.  Really this was a situation handled badly on the government's part but what did actually happened was actually mostly his own doing. The result which you see here has been a drama thats been on going for a few months.  Heres what happened basically:  1. Amos Yee posted a video doing the possibly most singaporean thing possible which is to sit infront of a camera and complain. Then make a blog.   2. Due to media backlash for insulting the PM (within a day of his death), the catholic religion and his own parents asking police to step in (stating they weren't able to control their child) caused the police to make an arrest.  3. He was later bailed by a man he later lied about sexually molesting him.  3. During his bail, one of the requirements was to not post statements relating to his case as it was under investigation which he broke (by blogging about it, content which stated the names of his investigating officer) and meeting with his probation officer  4. During his trial he requested a jail sentence when originally asked for reformative training.  So what are we left with? A bullshit headline from a biased website. This was never about free speech. It was simply a kid who kicked up a fuss about doing something so singaporean (complaining on the internet) and a media who loves to feed off the faults of Singapore's Government. They didn't handle it well to begin with yes and there have been singaporeans who have acted rashly due to his video (Amos Yee was also punched by a man on the way to court. This man was later trialed and found guilty for assualt in which he said he regretted) but what the fuck is worth reporting here?| 6| 2015-07-07 03:45:17

worldnews| animalzoo91111| As a Singaporean, I would like to point out that The Online Citizen is a very biased website which writes articles and words them in an extremely sensationalized and misleading manner.   Amos Yee himself had requested for a jail term while prosecution initially wanted to send him to reformative training. He also broke various conditions that were to be met while on bail, such as meeting with his probation officer, posting online content and even falsely accusing his bailor of molesting him. IMO these are aggravating factors which led to the 4 week sentence as well. His sentence was backdated to June 2nd, which meant he had served his term already.   As for what I feel, personally if he didn't try to attract so much attention to himself (as he tried to, and he sure got what he wanted) he wouldn't have been in such of a situation. I can't say that I agree with 4 weeks, but honestly to me, he put himself in this situation. I feel that he shouldn't have been sentenced for his comments alone, but taking into account what he has done while on bail, he definitely should have received some kind of a penalty. SG has traded certain civil liberties and freedoms for economic progress, rule of law and a very high standard of living, all accomplished in a very short period of time. Has it been successful? To a very large extent, yes. Could we have done it in another way? Maybe but probably not, given our local context 50 years ago. But can we start moving towards having more of the former? We are. Just really slowly. I do wish the pace would be faster but looking at the state of things, I feel that where we are now is somewhat justified.   Free speech in our society has limitations. There is no such thing as completely free speech. I was born to immigrant Chinese parents who strongly instilled in me the principle of respecting elders and being filial to them, and many people in our society hold truth to this belief. I do not think that we should blindly respect everyone from the generation above us, but definitely, LKY and his team are the reason why I am able to enjoy a (relatively) good life. Amos Yee goes against this very principle (tbh he stated some valid points but it was the way he brought it across) during a very sensitive period of time and it was why there was such outrage towards him (especially for the older generation, who have seen the transformation of SG ever since its independence). Rule of law is very much respected in our society as well and no that is not because of draconian penalties. Nobody actually gets fined $500 for eating and drinking on public transit. I feel that it's also a cultural / social thing that we have grown up with. Definitely I don't think there would be such a backlash if he were to put together a well written argumentative essay that wasn't riddled with so many vulgarities. For people who ask why he was thrown into jail for simply speaking his mind, yes he certainly can speak his mind, but in our society, there are certain restrictions that come with it. People talk about how nothing is black and white well free speech is not black and white either. And maybe, like I mentioned, if he didn't act the way he did, even after given multiple chances by the courts and having multiple people bail him out on different occasions, more people would have respect for him, and would stand up for him.  | 94| 2015-07-06 22:51:30

worldnews| Contraband_Fruit| Amos Yee is a lying piece of shit who's just running wild with the attention that he has been receiving by trying to turn himself into a martyr for Singapore.  From [Wiki:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Yee#Molestation_allegations_against_Law)  &gt;On 13 May 2015, barely a day after Yee was released, Yee took to Facebook, alleging that he had been molested by his ex-bailor Law. Law, when contacted, said the allegation was "false". Yee also invited the media to "catch" him at an Mass Rapid Transit station, but he did not show up. **Yee later revealed that his allegations were part of a ploy to "manipulate the press to indulge in the thoroughly exhausting experience of waiting in Pasir Panjang fruitlessly for several hours".**  Then, his sexual abuse claim got even more bizarre.  Again, from the Wiki:  &gt;Yee detailed how Law "violated him emotionally". He also highlighted that "molest" also means "disturb" and that his accusation of Law would be accurate if one used this definition instead, and hence concluded that he was "technically molested" by Law.  Yeah, you read that right.  Yee is just loony, and craves attention.

I just think that the basis of your original statement about human rights not being arbitrary was completely and utterly wrong.  As for Singapore, well... I'd like to think that in the case of Amos Yee, it isn't so much a freedom of speech issue *now* at least. We all know he was being hauled to court because he insulted old man Lee and not because of the charges against Christianity thing. But right now, contempt of court and refusal to abide by his probation terms. Outright framing of the man who bailed him out. Threatening suicide in remand. There's a lot to be said about how he has responded to the situation he's been placed in.  I never thought he was very right in the first place and really hoped that he'd get help before the whole thing blew up but well...| 3| 2015-07-06 16:32:13
singapore| Dreamwaltzer| It has been ~~-2-~~ 0 hours since we last had a thread on Amos Yee, and at last it is an actual news update.  so what now in the Amos saga...?  I assume everyone is going to go ape shit over how Singapore is so cruel for jailing a teenager, but I hope they read the article.   &gt; Yee had previously rejected the option of probation and a term in the Reformative Training Centre as a sentence, sticking to his original plea for a jail term.  Sadly I bet that this little fact will be lost when the outraged freedom speech activists write articles and blogposts about the Singaporean dictatorship oppressing us. | 16| 2015-07-06 15:46:36

Personally speaking I don't think we have a dissociative disorder, I get the feeling the HK people are protesting for the sake of protesting, plus the chances of them getting persecuted are less.   And lastly, these idiots are calling for stupid measures. The courts have found him guilty of two charges, and you think we will change our courts decision simply because a bunch of idiots overseas are whining?

singapore| cowbungaa| &gt; (on a dangerously unrelated note, the Amos Yee thing is the same imo. he's an unlikeable idiot, but is the punishment proportional to the offence?)  Amos only has himself to blame for his current predicament. He would only have received probation, without spending a single day in jail, if he had acted sensibly. I don't know about you, but for me probation would have been a fair punishment considering his initial offence.  Instead, he chose to do idiotic things like break bail terms, sabotage his bailor and reject probation. So it's evident that all of his wounds are self-inflicted. Even his "harsh" treatment in prison was a result of him being placed under suicide watch, after he claimed he was suicidal.| 3| 2015-07-01 23:45:39
singapore| guoshe| &gt;No, all this just shows that freedom of speech =/= freedom from consequences. The libel laws in Singapore, though harsh...   exactly. the real question is how do we decide what is a fair and just consequence? it's not like Roy was a highly influential person and that therefore his nonsense would have *caused harm and distress* to poor little PM. why is the judicial system so harsh when it comes to this kind of defamation case, and is it right?   I actually don't know the answer because I'm not that well-read on jurisprudence.

The statements and demands made by such organisations are often hyperbolic in nature, which often disregard the contexts in favour of narrow assessments strictly pertaining to human rights only. We all know that the world isn't that simple.  Not only do I hope that the handling of such sensitive issues would improve, I also hope that the West would adopt a more flexible way of assessing foreign issues that are tricky beyond their societies.| 9| 2015-06-23 19:39:18

badhistory| KaliYugaz| &gt;  That's how you create martyrs and call more attention to what they believed in the first place, thus spreading their vile hatred further than it might have otherwise gone.  That kind of reaction is not a cultural universal, and to think it is what must inevitably happen is just a mistaken projection of Western ideals. The incentive to fight against being banned can only exist in a culture that believes being banned for destructive speech is a bad thing.   For example, Amos Yee was recently arrested in Singapore for insulting a religious group in a Youtube video. Nobody in Singapore protested this, and indeed his very own neighbors were the ones who turned him in. Singaporeans simply don't have any tolerance for people trying to cause trouble on their island, which is why there never *is* any trouble on the island.  Furthermore, shutting down these forums will deprive the racists and sexists of a tool to recruit, organize, and radicalize, which actually does spread their message far and wide.| 12| 2015-06-22 01:15:52

atheism| spybio| In Singapore it's a crime to insult ANY beliefs. If a Christian insulted an Atheist based on his beliefs he would be punished accordingly. Amos Yee is facing jail time because he purposely ignored his previous sentence of probation. He not being punished for being an Atheist, he's being punished for being an asshole to other people| -4| 2015-06-21 16:15:04
atheism| derfshaya| I'm Singaporean too, and it's cool that you traced out the happenings and rationalised the behaviour of the govt and the people.  However, you have not factored the voices here into that rationalization. There are deeper reasons why dissidents and detractors make noise. If you think their goal is just to mess up the nation and push their own agenda, then you're perhaps mistaken. In the first place what is that agenda?  There are many points which sound okay to you but still beg questions. "Reformative Training Facilty"? Is it necessarily better than jail? Is Amos a sociopath or is he just different than the rest of us who are relatively conformists?  The government is made up of humans. Fallible beings. Yes, we might have policies set in place for ideal reasons. But these policies are created by the same flawed human beings, and executed by them. You think only Amos and the opposition have their own private agenda? I don't think so. I don't think the government is above making human mistakes.   We all have heard the tired story of how our security act protects the nation. Yes it has its logic and place. But probably it's about time those laws get revised. Freedom of speech is not just there so that people can be selfish and introduce chaos to society. For now, it may be represented by ever-evolving guidelines of what's acceptable and what's not, but I see it as a goal that we as humans work toward and keep in our minds, even though we may never see the day where it fits nicely with peace and stability.  Look, politics is a very dirty thing. Only the people truly involved will know what's going on. Not me for sure, and not you too. Incumbent and opposing parties will use all sorts of tricks to attain their goals. There are individuals in the government and in opposition who play strongly by the rules and respect their opponents. Power to them. But then they are just individuals in the system.  I think what matters is you and I, instead of defending the current government or defending Amos Yee (and demonizing the other party), keep our own values at heart and speak of what we really truly feel. Be the voice of reason, not an advocate.  I sincerely thank you for speaking up.| 27| 2015-06-21 15:25:54

worldnews| DarkTowersWeTrust| The core problem with your argument is precisely that Singapore is not a democracy, and you think it to be. Singapore may be a republic, but a democracy? Not exactly. Free speech is inalienable from democratic process, and as soon as you bar free speech in a meaningful way, you're no longer operating under democratic process.   Amos Yee was exercising free speech. Ostensibly, he was convicted of offending Christianity and obscenity. The offending Christianity conviction invokes a law intended to defend Singapore against racially/religiously charged internecine violence, it is essentially a throw-back to the 60s when Singapore was divided among racial/religious lines. As for the obscenity charge, well, it would be hypocritical to censor him when there are countless others posting "obscene" images (which, coincidentally, usually aren't politically charged). These two laws are only being applied to Yee because the government wishes to silence a critic, and hence, limit free speech. This is essentially a breach of democratic process. It's a perversion of the law and a cynical interpretation of Singapore's legalist underpinnings. It is a rehash of what happened to J. B. Jeyaretnam.  The problem with your "one-man, one-vote" referencing is that Singapore does not operate under this principle. Yes, every man gets a vote, but the essence of this saying is that every vote counts equally, which is untrue. The electoral processes in Singapore are deeply and fundamentally flawed. The very fact that the Electoral Commission is a branch of the PM's office and not an independent body is indicative of a government that does not take its elections seriously. Furthermore, the constituencies in Singapore are so systemically gerrymandered that it is bordering on absurdity.  Until these issues are fixed, and until the government stops attempting to so brazenly silence critics, describing Amos Yee's imprisonment as the "will of the people" is preposterous. | 2| 2015-06-17 09:43:43
singapore| tsukuruu| &gt; What you see in Singapore is an exercise of desperate imagination. It’s not about innovation because it’s sexy, but because it’s survival.  Also, Amos Yee reference!| 3| 2015-06-17 08:20:23
worldnews| DarkTowersWeTrust| This is true. However, the law under which Amos was convicted is rarely invoked, as it is supposed to be applied to malicious inter-faith/inter-ethnic hate. The law is essentially a leftover from the 1960s when it was necessary to regulate this kind of shit as the race/religion divides in Singapore were violent. Charging Amos Yee with it is absurd as it takes the law out of its intended context. It's like charging an 18 year old for the statutory rape of his 17 year old girlfriend. The Christian community isn't going to start a race riot over this crap, in fact, they could give two fucking shits about what Amos Yee says.   The imprisonment of Amos Yee is a brazen attempt by the PAP to silence a critic. They are notorious for using legal means to shut serious opposition up. They did this to J. B. Jeyaretnam and others, it isn't the first time. | 5| 2015-06-17 08:16:00
worldnews| DarkTowersWeTrust| Doesn't change the fact that the *reasons* for Amos Yee being in jail are totally bogus. We're imprisoning a 16 year old for talking shit about Christianity, it is patently absurd.

worldnews| iemfi| To nitpick the age of consent in Singapore is 16. It's a dick move to falsely accuse someone even in jest but it's not an offence you go to jail over, a fine at most.   Anyway this is all besides the point. Amos Yee could also  have murdered a litter of kittens and a baby. If he did he would be charged and convicted of those crimes separately, not sent to jail on a bullshit charge. Stop trying to justify sending a 16 year old boy to prison over a youtube video. You make Singapore look worse than it already does.| 3| 2015-06-17 07:19:34

worldnews| iemfi| You and those Singaporean redditors make me very sad to be a Singaporean. Fuck all of you, it's incredibly depressing that most people here are completely apathetic that a 16 year old is in jail for the crime of talking ill of Christianity. You can find the original video on youtube (search for Amos Yee original video), I won't link to it for obvious reasons. It's rather cringy but the "offence to Christianity" part is ridiculously mild.  1. The conditions of his bail were complete bullshit, the crime itself is complete bullshit, it's like saying Rosa Parks deserved to get kicked off the bus because she was breaking the law.   2. It was a stupid attempt to show how the media reports stuff without fact checking. It's wrong but it was not a serious accusation and doesn't warrant jail time. And even the Singaporean courts didn't charge him for this.  3. The whole point is that he's protesting an unjust law.| 27| 2015-06-17 03:05:08
worldnews| iambamba| It's not my government. Enough with the assumptions. You seem to know practically nothing about the case. He launched an expletive-filled rant against the father of his country just days after he died. If I were the Singaporean government I'd be more worried about public outcry against the kid than how a dim 16-year old's video reflects on me.  But that's not even the point, because he wasn't arrested for criticising the government. He was taken in for insulting religion. You might not think that's a big deal but in this part of the world it's the kind of thing that tears society apart. Singapore and Malaysia both have painful memories of racial riots and Singapore has a fragile mix of cultures and faiths. There is such a thing as public order. I don't know if it's justified to put Amos Yee behind bars, but I do know that it sure isn't black and white.| 10| 2015-06-16 21:44:53

worldnews| DarkTowersWeTrust| A big welcome to the Singaporean government, everyone!!   The law under which Amos Yee was convicted is indeed intended to safeguard Singapore's multicultural stability, but the context in which it is meant to be invoked is quite different. It's supposed to prevent Christian organisations from depicting Muhammad, for example. Amos Yee's rude depictions of Christian figures isn't going to inspire a 13 May Incident.   Furthermore, the charge of "sedition" is fundamentally indicative of an authoritarian regime which won't tolerate (serious!) opposition. Sure, it's legal. It's just as legal as the PAP's systemic gerrymandering of the elections. But legal doesn't equal fair, just, or right. | 14| 2015-06-16 20:11:54

singapore| validpoints| You think you're sly, but you haven't addressed the point.  Amos doesn't fit into present day Singapore.  He'd be perfectly at home in many other countries.  His attitudes and behaviors are not at all unusual for a kid of his age questioning the lies they've been brought up to believe.  It's not Amos who is in the wrong, Singapore is.  No one here wants to hear that, but it's the truth.  In 20 years, if this country manages to grow up by then, a lot of people will think back on Amos Yee and be ashamed of their attitudes towards him.| -4| 2015-06-15 02:23:31
singapore| lucatri| Yes, his bailor bailed him out, saying that he forgave Amos despite being a Christian himself. Then Amos went ahead and made those remarks against him- I'd expect a normal teenager to at least show some gratitude in that case, but I suppose there's no humbling someone like Amos Yee.   His actions against the reporters are understandable, perhaps, but what he did to Vincent was truly confusing. Why do you bite the only hand stretching out to help you? This just shrinks the pool of people willing to help him should he get himself into major trouble again.| 10| 2015-06-14 17:49:33

singapore| sumuraijack2010| Singapore officials are probably the least corrupted people you will ever see in the world. Probably... because there are some cases of shady dealings but they don't harm the general public much.   And about the freedom of expression, it is NOTHING like US where people are like "I can say whatever I want, its freedom of speech". Yeah sure, but those people who say that is usually followed by some dumb opinion on something. Like in Singapore, I am sure you have seen Amos Yee being that 'freedom of expression' guy but you just HAVE to watch what you say. People are very fragile here and everywhere else and when you say shit about one of the best countries without much conflict, you really have to just appreciate it. Singapore government is oppressive as they control what ideologies are passed around and believed, to make sure that no civil war occurs between races such as Malay, Chinese and Indians.   We live in harmony, and without harmony, Singapore is no longer the safest place to be. So, IF you want to apply for a job here and live here, you will have a pleasant time. Just make sure to NOT be a dick about your opinions. If you think that anyone who hears your opinion out loud would get offended, just don't say it out loud. Keep it to yourself. | 8| 2015-06-08 11:44:38

singapore| Dreamwaltzer| erm, what? What point am I missing exactly?   That we're stretching our laws to try and prosecute him? I'm fully aware of that, and what it does to the concept of free speech in Singapore. I think most people are.   But that doesn't mean I'm not allowed to dislike Amos Yee. The dude is a twat. Always was annoying, even before he jumped the shark and insulted LKY. Even after the LKY incident, his actions and attitude have show me that he as absolutely no merits wo But these are different issues.  A blogger getting arrested for expressing his own view, regardless of how silly it is, is a blow to Singapore and the notion of free speech.    However, I disagree with Amos Yee's opinions, and think its annoying as fuck how he just disrespects so many things simply because he personally thinks otherwise. In short I do not like Amos Yee and hope more people run over and slap him.   He gained his fame by deliberately stirring people up. Now he faces the consequences.   | 2| 2015-06-04 01:49:38
singapore| mrq1989| Fucking hilarious is a understatement.   &gt;1st charge – Charged for deliberately intending to wound the religious feelings of Christians in general and the feelings of Fong Huiling Pamela, female 26 years old and Lim Zijin, male 27 years old in particular (Section 298 – wounding religious feelings of a person either verbally or through an action) Punishment of up to 3 years, fine or both.  &gt;&gt; ...deliberately...  &gt;&gt;&gt; ...***DELIBERATELY***....   Fucking kid does't even know who those 2 clowns are.  He was essentially charged for causing [butthurt](http://i.imgur.com/7KpyLAZ.png) to people who read his blog and hated it so much that they had to make their way down to the police station to bitch about a 16 year old boy.  Since no one in this thread has asked : **WHAT IS /r/Singapore's  PROBLEM WITH AMOS YEE?**  Your (not you /u/DanielAgger) beliefs (about jesus/lky/konghee) are so strong you let a **16 YEAR OLD** blog post make you loose faith just so you can run to the popo to sort him out?  Bonus fun fact - you *don't need* a 16 year old's blog to make you question your own belief.   Edit: format| 33| 2015-06-02 21:46:46
singapore| qilled| The state media's interactions with Amos Yee feels like watching a troll being fed on national level. He's not going to change. Dude is just going to launch another hurricane of blog posts slamming the government the moment he gets out. | 25| 2015-06-02 19:52:06

Brunei| 2h113f0| I thought we have lots of them already? Joke. Amos Yee did write something about teachers being too inside the box. http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/%5Bwot%5D-amos-yee%92s-exciting-adventure-zhonghua-secondary-school-5010254.html| 1| 2015-06-01 19:45:06
AskReddit| ElvenAshwin| I referenced that kid in my comment. Amos Yee.  He only managed to get arrested because 19 people filed police reports on him (including his own mother), and he's generally very hated. He was specifically arrested for the words against Christianity.  And the thing is, the laws against insulting a religion are hardly enforced. You have to go out of your way to be a dick to get hit with jail time, because you need many people to report you first.  Amos Yee didn't help himself when he claimed that he was molested by his BAILOR (ie, a person helping him), and then not show up to the investigation, and then laugh it off saying that he was "joking" just to see the "reactions" and that he just found the guy creepy.  That's actually illegal in most countries, because its slander.| 3| 2015-05-30 23:31:27
AskReddit| smuttyblueberry| If I may disagree, the whole debacle around Amos Yee has been sensationalized by the media. And I think Western media did not really follow up on the initial reports which yes, seemingly indicated that he was being charged for political dissent.  http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/courts-crime/story/amos-yee-find-out-verdict-his-case-tuesday-afternoon-20150512  He was not jailed for political dissent (and you can't really take it as dissent seriously...) but for "uploading an obscene image and making remarks intending to hurt the feelings of Christians"  He was jailed for photoshopping a picture of Margaret Thatcher having sex with LKY and insulting Christians on his youtube video. Political dissent is NOT an issue here.| 3| 2015-05-30 23:26:00
AskReddit| ElvenAshwin| Ughh...   Singaporean here. For fuck's sake, if this is a totalitarian dictatorship it sure as hell doesn't feel like it. I can tell LKY to go fuck himself, or disagree with LHL's policies, or think that the government is run by a bunch of idiots and nothing happens to me.  You have to try REALLY hard to get hit with a jail hammer. There's nothing against the law that you would do normally (Exception: Homosexuality, which thankfully is not enforced but should be changed). The only person I've known to be hit with a sedition suit in the modern era, after Lee Kuan Yew's amazing libel lawsuit sprees, is Amos Yee. And only because Singaporeans hated him enough because he's annoying as fuck and his statistics were terribly wrong (60% tax rate? Max is 20%, and that's for REALLY rich people) . Not saying its *right* I'm saying its rare to get locked up.| 2| 2015-05-30 23:06:45

singapore| thefatkittycat| I, personally want free speech, but doubt it will happen in SG. Now in my school, teachers are putting down students by telling them they are similar to Amos yee, if anyone questions why put constitutionally guaranteed right of free speech is being restricted. | 1| 2015-05-25 23:57:10
singapore| Goated| I identify as a furry trans dragonkin  and I believe in Pokemon, so...  No, srsly. Look at the social, political climate of where you are. It has its flaws, which everyone condemns.  And then you step back a little, and there's a very basic realisation that The People where you are, are as such. There can be much ado about nothing, as we've had over the gay penguin book.   Most people surveyed didn't even know about it.   And then, as a person, you have one of two choices. Try to change things, or keep your head down, and relish the brief moments of camaraderie you find with the like-minded that you meet. Most of them are in the same situation.   Put your weight behind things when it counts. It is hard to start a movement against established inertia. If you can start it, great. If not, join the rest of us in trying to solve the pragmatic portions of life, while always looking out for that beacon of something something.  Amos Yee isn't it. He's more than the rest of us sitting here typing shit, but he has too much idealism and ego to cause any sort of change. | -2| 2015-05-25 09:38:46

singapore| shqippotato| Let's be real about this. Removing any and all limits to free speech means you're also giving nutjob Liberals and Conservatives a platform to spew out their extreme ideologies. Militant feminazis are going to rally to "kill all men" while far-Right groups will push for persecution of LGBTs, abolition of minimum wage, welfare, etc.   Is this the kind of society we want to create based the Western ideal of absolute free speech? [This is what happens when you have unmitigated freedom of speech.](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/us/gunmen-killed-after-firing-on-anti-islam-groups-event.html?_r=0) People will never stop wielding their right to freedom of speech as a weapon against groups/minorities/religions they oppose.  Also, please let's not bullshit ourselves into accepting the notion that freedom of speech is not about hatred and vitriol, but about the progression of local politics and moving towards a better future. Noble goals, yes, but do you find yourself being hauled to court for criticising Temasek's $40b fiasco? Saw Phaik Hua's ineptitude of managing SMRT? Gerrymandering? Singaporeans have by and large been able to conduct political debates online and offline without any "casualties", so to speak. People like Roy Ngerng and Amos Yee got under the spotlight because they crossed the line (one accusing PM Lee on false grounds, the other with religious remarks). I don't Alfian Sa'at having to go to court despite his obvious anti-establishment stance.| 3| 2015-05-22 10:26:34
singapore| hamsalamibacon| Our people as a whole prefer peace and stability. Having unfiltered Western style free speech will obviously lead to societal friction which will definitely affect racial tensions, especially in a small city-state like SG.   Hell, look at the Amy Cheong saga. Imagine those fb posts happening every day. Imagine an Amos Yee popping up every week, and a dumb old man slapping him afterwards.   We look at unfiltered free speech (unfiltered to an extent, but no where near as stifling as in SG) and we say fuck no. | 5| 2015-05-22 07:05:04

AskReddit| dppow| I fully support freedom of speech but Amos Yee is just an attention whore (judging from his recent actions)| 1| 2015-05-18 23:50:38
AskReddit| thebigsplat| Amos Yee is a terrible person to use as a positive example. He's an immature boy who over the past few days has alienated pretty much all his supporters by claiming his bailor molested him, laughing it off and saying he was trolling the media, apologizing and then retracting his apologies.   Didnt help that the government nailed him through sedition for anti religious comments and not the Lee Kuan Yew comments.   Singapore has different freedom of speech standards. We ban anti religious/racial remarks because of their potentially inflammatory nature, partly because we're a society that as a whole would rather do without Westboro baptist situations.   Freedom of speech is still somewhat curtailed when it comes to political matters, but this is rapidly changing, although you wouldn't wanna do it if you work in the civil service/public service. Singapore is still a very small place if people in high places don't like you.   Lee Kuan Yew was a very effective leader who did ruthless and undemocratic things.  He kicked I think half the population out of their homes? Arrested the Communists who help him get into power with the help of the British and deported most of them without trial. But he built housing apartments that 80% of our population lives in, in place of the slums. And in his words, yes he didn't play fair in the elections, but if the communists won, there would have been no more elections. | 1| 2015-05-18 07:42:12
AskReddit| ohaiyofman| Singapore has taken a pragmatic approach to race and religious relations, stressing societal stability over almost anything when it comes to domestic policies. However with that said, there are only a few state "recognised" religions, which are the mainstream ones such as Christianity, Islam, Buddhism etc. Religions that don't serve or are hold inimical views to the government's idea of the aforementioned social cohesion such as Jehovah's Witnesses are seen as cults, most probably in this example due to its adherents  not being allowed to serve military service, which all males in Singapore have to go through when they reach 18 years of age.   With regard to its minorities, its very varied. Atheists or Agnostics don't really have any issues, so much so that being one isn't something that is noteworthy or going to turn up in conversation. The LGBT community on the other hand is another story. It is illegal to be a homosexual in the sense that homosexual acts are punishable under the law, but I cannot recall anybody every being prosecuted to this end. So there won't be any secret police or anyone kicking down your door if you're with your partner, but marriage or any legal union is out of the question.   And Amos Yee? I think regardless of whether one agrees or not with what he says, most can agree that he's a grade A+ asshole. Standing up for what he believes in is one thing, but alienating those who most need to understand what free speech is through his behaviour and statements is just childish as hell. | 21| 2015-05-18 01:45:15
AskReddit| Betadyne| I think my generation still respects him, but nowhere near the extent of the older generation. We were born in great housing conditions, with a stable economy, almost an utopia, so we are grateful to him for that. But, at the same time, we aren't the direct beneficiaries of his policies, so it's more something we know rather than something we feel, if you catch my drift. He isn't seen in a perfect light; he crushed all political opposition in Singapore with a ruthless disrespect for human rights, in order to ram his brilliant policies and well thought-out plans down our throats. Plus, because of the newspaper propaganda we're regularly exposed to, and an improvement in education over our parents(thanks to the education system for trying to teach critical thinking in trying to develop a "knowledge-based economy", but maybe they shouldn't have), we wonder how much of the affection we feel/are supposed to feel towards him is truly deserved.  The situation in Singapore regarding free speech is somewhat different from most countries; most people here trust that the government will do the right thing, because it has always been that way. Even when there are issues, people tend to complain to the government, not so much about it. Free speech is traded in for security because there hasn't been a need for it. I'm personally concerned for the day when we find out that we need it and not have it, but for most people, if you ask them to choose between being sued into oblivion as a political activist, or a stable, comfortable, quiet life, people will very understandably choose the latter. I think people become political activists only beyond a certain threshold of oppression and misuse of power, and there haven't been any signs that the political elite are no longer working for the welfare of the people. While I wish for a better work-life balance and employee rights, we're still paid well, have a roof over our heads, do not lack food or medicine or water, so there hasn't been a real reason to exercise a right to freedom of speech in a while.  Amos yee is seen as a troublemaker here. To top it off, his recent antics aren't doing him any favours. Nevertheless, it is by no means unanimously agreed that he should have been arrested; kids are going to be kids, and harmless antics like these shouldn't have been met with legal action.| 49| 2015-05-18 00:32:27

TrueAskReddit| taimoor2| &gt;Singaporean here. There are some things unique to Singapore that other countries will find hard to replicate. For example, the government provided public housing throughout the entire country, which is currently at about 80%.  [US actually has more empty homes than homeless people](http://www.truthdig.com/eartotheground/item/more_vacant_homes_than_homeless_in_us_20111231). Other countries CAN replicate it. They are too concerned with their ideals and are not willing to bend.  &gt; Education is compulsory up to the age of 16, and guarantees basic math, science and reading skills.  [Compulsory education was only introduced in 2003](http://www.moe.gov.sg/initiatives/compulsory-education/). Singapore was already a developed country by then. Also, literacy rates already approach 100% in developed world. It's not the main issue.  &gt;This is money being invested that doesn't see a return until 20-40 years later, and if current politicians don't see the immediate return on their investment, its hard to pass reform in the first place.  Yes, other country's politicians are short-term idiots. I agree with you on this.  &gt;Singapore is also a one party democracy, where PAP controls 90% of constitutencies in Singapore, and a unified government won't have 2 political parties bickering and arguing at each other and not getting anything done. Good luck for a political party in a third world country anywhere to sweep 90%, given a fair election in the first place.  And this, I think, is the crux of the issue. [We know that the best way to rule is to actually have a party of benevolent philosopher kings.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher_king) However, the problem is people are greedy and they stop serving the country. [Lee kuan yew was also greedy](http://singaporedissident.blogspot.sg/2014/01/singapores-worst-thieves-lee-kuan-yew.html) but he had the foresight to think that benefiting the country while getting rich himself was more sustainable and profitable as compared to just looting and running. That's the different between a genius and an idiot. I am sure his love for country helped.  &gt;There are a lot of state owned agencies as well, e.g. state-owned television and print media. Singapore ranks really low in International Press Freedom rankings as well, and we have pretty tough censorship laws. It's a price to pay in return for this though. At least we won't get FOX-News type of news, but our information is censored here and there.  This, again, is something I am only beginning to understand as I grow old. I am realising that some freedoms need to be curbed. Look at Altaf hussain in Pakistan who is terrorising the country through his speeches. Look at Ayotallah in Iran and how he gained power. Perhaps, spouting bull shit for sake of getting attention ([looking at you Amos Yee](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/amos-yee--extremely-remorseful--over-molest-allegations-against-bailor-vincent-law-012338531.html)), may not be best for the country.   &gt;We also have tough laws like the death penalty that are enforced pretty harshly that help to keep the streets safe at night.  You never really appreciate this till you have lived in a "dangerous" city. I love this about Singapore.  &gt;You won't be able to bribe any law-enforcer or state agency in Singapore.  [Because they are paid well](http://forum.brightsparks.com.sg/archive/index.php/t-143.html). They have [no incentive to cheat](http://www.transitioning.org/2012/07/25/are-our-civil-servants-overly-paid-compared-to-the-private-sector/) and a [strong disincentive to cheat](http://blog.moneysmart.sg/opinion/singapores-top-5-corruption-cases-so-far/). That's why public servants need to be paid well and have good career options. I don't know why other countries don't realize this. They are going to take money; by hook or crook. Pay them well!| 15| 2015-05-17 22:05:34
singapore| Azuredrak| My comment in ***Bolded Italics***. Basically, what it says is,   "Amos's latest act is not in line with his strive for freedom of speech (he used to be genuinely fighting for a noble cause ***Lol please, he never has been***). Vincent Law is a good man, Amos Yee is an asshole. We, the people, are riled up due to the government's supression of free speech. Let us continue to fight on and ignore Amos' latest disgraceful act!"  If you want an even shorter version, it would be "We are no longer associated with or supportive of Amos Yee."

singapore| sgwarrior| Sigh, on mobile, so I'll try to make this quick. I just find it refreshing to be hearing it straight from the horse's mouth rather than through any media outlets, both alternative and msm. He's got good points and strategy for exposing 'hypocrisy' (or human weakness, rather), methods somewhat unorthodox but typical (to me) for an angst filled, proud and cynical teenager. I don't think people dislike him now just becuz he's a troll; ppl dislike him because he has exposed their prejudices, with regards to inconsistencies about what they believe in freedom of speech etc.  In summary, he's a smart kid, good intentions, very bitter even though he claims otherwise. Just needs some love la. Although, that doesn't mean that he is wrong about Vincent. I pity the guy, Christians who set out to behave like saints. It takes a very strong person to be truly nice, without conditions, and I think he just set the bar too high for himself. Hope that makes sense.  Fyi, I'm not a supporter of Amos Yee, just striving for a balanced viewpoint.| -9| 2015-05-16 13:49:42
singapore| Dreamwaltzer| Amos Yee has shown he as no qualms with defamatory statements so I take anything he says about Vincent with  quite a lot of suspicion. So, pretty much 3/4 of his post was read with a certain level of incredulity.   But regardless of what he says about Vincent, and how true it is, he screws himself over this this. &gt; I had already intended to publicly humiliate Vincent.   Just shows his intent, so he's got pretty much zero defense against any defamation suit.  And his "defense" about him saying Vincent molested him is   &gt; mo·lest   &gt; (mə-lĕst′)   &gt; tr.v. mo·lest·ed, mo·lest·ing, mo·lests   &gt; 1. To disturb, interfere with, or annoy  and   &gt; one possesses an IQ that was more than 2 digits, one would probably have already guessed right from the start that it was all a troll.(Dick Ow.?

singapore| dtwn| I really wonder what universe you inhabit.   Amos Yee accuses bailor of molest.  *Amos Yee is such an aggrieved young man!*  Amos Yee recants his accusation. *Yes, it's that evil bailor's fault." What in the flying fuck?  Since you purport to be Christian, here are a couple of verses you should consider.  Titus 3:1 Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to do whatever is good,  Romans 13:1 Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.  Exodus 20:16 You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.| 7| 2015-05-16 11:36:22
singapore| denocorp| Most people in The Netherlands also know very well what Singapore is, if not where it's located.  Things like LKY's passing and the court case against Amos Yee have been in the news in Holland, as well as the usual 'fun' items e.g. huge fines for littering and corporal punishment for graffiti. We also have close economic ties mainly due to the shipping industry.| 3| 2015-05-15 11:17:46
singapore| Multech| Well, yes, if you were counsel for the media, you would try arguing all the defenses and hope that at least one would stick. But remember that Amos retracted his allegation the same day and after searching, I couldn't find any article that didn't publish his retraction alongside his allegation. Ultimately, I think the media will say that since they published the retraction in the same article, they didn't defame Vincent at all. Usually, if the "bane" and the "antidote" are in the same article, no defamation exists.   As a matter of discussion and speculation here however, I am doubtful that QP would work as a defence for the media. While the public may be interested in knowing that Vincent has been accusing of sexual assault by Amos Yee, it is not in the public interest for such information to be published. In the case you referred to, the issue was surrounding that of an outbreak of some disease - information regarding an outbreak being released is probably in the public interest.   However, if Amos Yee accused a minister in government of sexual assault, QP would maybe apply as the public would both be interested in receiving the information AND it would be in their interest to receive such information as the minister is an important public figure with control of public funds, is a role model etc etc. | 1| 2015-05-15 09:49:25
singapore| Multech| No, it doesn't have to be vindictive but there are usually three reasons to go to the trouble of suing someone for defamation.   1) Damages - but here we know that Amos Yee can't even afford to pay court costs. Amos will struggle to pay any damages awarded by the court to Vincent.   2) To be vindicated in court - but here we know that Amos Yee retracted his allegation the same day and the media is widely reporting both the allegation and retraction. Also, even if they didn't report the retraction, who in Singapore would believe Amos anyway? I would say, damage to his reputation is minimal at best. He doesn't need to be vindicated in court.   3) To be vindictive/take revenge on someone - If Vincent really does end up suing him, this would probably be the only real reason since the other two probably aren't at play. Sure, even if Amos can't afford to pay Vincent damages, the stress of being sued would be some kind of payback, I suppose. | 1| 2015-05-15 09:32:26
singapore| Syptryn| Too may people hop on the bandwagon that 'free speech is good' that  western media loves to harp about - without understanding that there are always boundaries. There should always be free speech, but  it should be executed responsibly.   We should always have the right to criticize the government - but using facts and logic; not rhetoric and abuse. The point after all, is create a better society - not to bury logical discussion in a sea of hate speech.  I am glad this whole fiasco with Amos Yee happened - hopefully it'll make people realize that free speech should come with responsibility.| 8| 2015-05-14 22:53:55
singapore| Hope83| I can never understand this whole circus.   While I think Amos Yee is a total ungrateful moron to do this to his own benefactor, I also have to question Vincent Law's initial statement of defending Amos Yee's right to free speech and the now turnaround simply because his own reputation and family is hurt.   Is it not obvious right from the beginning that Amos Yee was never about free speech but the abuse of it? Was it not obvious that all along he is just simply an arrogant irresponsible immature teenager who never cares about the consequences of what he says and how it may hurt others? That was the right to free speech that Vincent Law initially defended him on.   If you want to defend someone's right to free speech, then you have to accept and understand that some people will inevitably abuse it and hurt people and that may include you.   I always believe that freedom of speech comes with responsibility. It was clear as bright as day even before this whole circus act occur that Amos Yee has never demonstrated any sense of responsibility as a person. I wonder why some people took so long to realize that. | 8| 2015-05-14 21:16:08
singapore| Multech| Exactly. Amos Yee is not worth suing as he wouldn't be able to pay any damages to Vincent anyway. But Vincent could still sue, just to be vindictive. | 2| 2015-05-14 20:16:09
singapore| Multech| Yes, yes, he can.   ~~The media can avoid liability by making out a defence of innocent dissemination under the common law though.~~ On second thought, I was probably not correct re innocent dissemination. As /u/Offtothelawmines points out below, innocent dissemination is probably not at play here. We also had a discussion below on whether the media can claim qualified privilege as a defense - I would claim that they wouldn't succeed with using QP while /u/Offtothelawmines isn't entirely convinced.  So, if the media was brought to court, what would they say? Does Vincent have a good claim against the media?Amos retracted his allegation the same day and after searching online, I couldn't find any article that didn't publish his allegation against Vincent alongside his retraction. Ultimately, I think the media will say that since they published the retraction in the same article, they didn't defame Vincent at all. Usually, if the "bane" and the "antidote" are in the same article, no defamation exists. **In short, the media won't claim qualified privilege OR innocent dissemination as a defense - they will just deny defaming Vincent in the first place.**    Edit: But he probably won't *(sue Amos Yee)*. The first thing a lawyer will ask before suing on behalf of their clients is, is the person worth suing? If Amos Yee can't even pay his own bail, he is not worth suing. Unless, he is happy suing just so he can be vindicated in court. BUT, in this case, I would say that any lawyer worth his salt would strongly advise against suing just to be vindicated. This is because most people would probably not believe Amos Yee, and thus any damage to his reputation would be minimal at best; suing Amos would be a waste of time unless he wants to be vindictive.  Edit: just realized my edit above is about him suing Amos himself. The media is definitely a worthwhile target for litigation because they have lots of $$$ lol. | 14| 2015-05-14 19:56:03

However, we should respect the law and the legal process, and understand underlying rationale as to why Amos Yee was prosecuted.| 1| 2015-05-13 15:48:28
worldnews| AncientThrowback| Singaporean here:  The main reason "insulting religious feelings" is a comparatively big deal here is because Singapore has 4 major ethnic groups (Chinese, Malay, Indian and Eurasian) and is such a small country in a region that in the past few decades has proved to be rather unstable. As such our existence is dependent on our community being as harmonious as possible in defending the values we stand for, lest sabre-rattling by our significantly larger neighbours end up escalating to anything more. And to promote that, racial harmony as well as tolerance for different denominations are extremely emphasised here.  Singapore as a country has had a rather turbulent past in our rather short 50-year history. We have had race riots crippling the country when it was just nascent, while [Maria Hertogh](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Hertogh_riots) divided the community along religious lines before our independence from the United Kingdom.  Singapore's success as an economic, transport, and logistics hub in the region depends on the interest overseas partners show in the country - investment here is pretty much the golden word. Instability leads to a decrease in investment, that much is obvious.  To encroach on the sensitivities of our many denominations would be an attack to our common Singaporean identity, and can be seen as an attack on Singapore itself. Amos Yee attacked what he saw as the ignorance of local Christians towards the true word of God, some other religious affronts I have not the time to look up, and slandering the legacy of Lee Kuan Yew, our founding father. This is the equivalent of slandering George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and the other founding fathers of the USA, while also telling the majority of a religious population that their faiths completely lack basis.   In response to /u/existentialadvisor: Evolution is taught in school. And we don't have many, if at all, vocal creationism advocates, as even the Church here would seem to be open to the concept that the genesis of the human race was based upon Darwinian concepts.  In response to /u/CorsairoNero: "Insulting religious feelings" may sound Tumblr-y, I agree. However it is probably apt to classify what Amos Yee did as such, although what he did, especially in our local context, has far more implications.| 4| 2015-05-13 13:30:53
singapore| deedowise| Whatever one might feel about Amos Yee, he is one unapologetically tough cookie...| 1| 2015-05-13 00:15:10
singapore| 37phonehome| Oh please, not the "no harm=no crime" thing again. You can be convicted for inchoate offences, including an attempted crime, even if there was absolutely no harm. It's policy, not morality.   What Amos did was a crime under the laws of Singapore. If you think it's not supposed to be a crime, what you should be doing is lobbying for change (as 377A activists and conservative Christians do all day), mounting a constitutional challenge, or weakening the responsible political party (which is arguably possible in Singapore, admittedly difficult). That's the essence of democracy. The people who do this have it right on democracy.   On the other hand, people who stubbornly commit the crime, and after that say it shouldn't be a crime (ie Amos Yee?) - these are not advocates of democracy, but of anarchy.   PS: if you read s 298 or 298A of the Penal Code, it is clear the crime is based on pure intention/knowledge. No harm is required. Surprise! Of course, if you think the law is wrong, it should be challenged by democratic process and not by committing the crime. | 7| 2015-05-12 22:38:18
singapore| mungojerries| I am not rejecting counselling, as I said in my post 'maybe counselling will help', if it is being offered then I believe anyone should use counselling services as they are extremely helpful in lots of situation.  Just because he is different doesn't mean needs to changed.  Seriously if you take that view that anyone who has a different opinion must be changed then there would be no progress in the world. What you define as a 'normal' child is only temporary, 'normal' is constantly changing.    Imagine when the first slaves rose up against their white masters and said they wanted to be paid and have freedom. They were jailed and beaten for suggesting those things. White masters would say the same thing 'not normal' 'not acceptable' 'needs to return to his senses' Does that mean in hindsight they were wrong?? Sometimes it takes a stubborn and different person to bring change to a system.   By the way, I don't mean in any way to compare Amos Yee to the men who rose against slavery, I am just using this example to argue your point that just because someone is an outlier or different does not mean they need to be changed.| 5| 2015-05-12 21:16:51
singapore| Azuredrak| But how many other "boys around the world" dared to take it to the extent he did? Normal kids would have backed off much more easily. Going by your logic, if the actions are only part of the growing phase, why did others not run into similar situations? Tell me, if you were 16 and got jailed for some video you created, would you take it down and apologise? Chances are, you would, so would other "16 year old boys around the world".  The numbers tell us that Amos Yee is an outlier who has demonstrated willingness to go to the extremes, this is what separated him from the "boys around the world". This meant that he has gone overboard, that his actions are not acceptable, and that he is definitely not normal. This is why he needs counselling, he needs more help than normal kids do to aid him in returning to his senses. Counselling is a good thing, I don't see the reason you guys are rejecting it so strongly. You are making counselling out to be something close to the mental hospital, it's really a different thing.| 3| 2015-05-12 20:32:47

atheism| oklos| I'm familiar enough with the broad strokes of those (even if not the precise statistics).  I think we can leave aside the book you refer to, since it states that "Dahl makes it clear that his definition is an ideal type of democracy, which has not yet been achieved in any country in the world", making this not terribly useful as a basis for discussion, unless you want to point out something a bit more specific.  I'm not sure why you linked me to the 2002 report for Freedom House, but at any rate, the only real substantive change in regulation broadly has been with regard to online media. None of those issues are really news to informed Singaporeans, at any rate, except maybe the specifics or some of the less prominent examples. Similarly, low rankings on international press freedom and democracy ratings are generally well-publicised enough even in local media. All of this is accessible enough to Singaporeans online. (On a personal level, I'm also highly sceptical of quantitative measures of qualitative issues, but that's rather digressing here.)  The question isn't really whether there are problems; there are numerous issues with Singaporean democracy, plenty of which Singaporeans complain about fairly often. In the context of this thread, the question is whether there has been progress in this regard, and for all the attention on particular cases such as Leslie Chew, Amos Yee and Alex Au, the general level of public discourse, especially in social media and blogs, has contained copious amounts of anti-government rhetoric, and even the state-controlled media has taken a more nuanced view of some of these issues (even while retaining a clear pro-government bias); this points to some level of progress in political discourse, even if reluctant.  In terms of actual elections, Singapore does all the technical aspects excellently: there are few if any issues of voting ease or security. Broadly speaking, while FPTP is a problem for the correlation of overall vote percentage with actual representation in Parliament, there is little doubt that a clear majority of the population does actually support the government consistently. Indeed, Singapore has arguably performed these fundamental running of elections more effectively and consistently than the US has on several fronts, despite the latter being a full democracy.| 1| 2015-05-12 00:05:16

atheism| RayZR| Amos Yee has been brought in under the charge of inciting racial discourse. A little roundabout and I hope he isn't criminally convicted on any count; but the thing is he hadn't been convicted in any way, just brought in to court under some charges.  I don't agree with bringing him in, and I hope they drop the charges because, as much as I disagree with what he said, he had the right to voice his opinion, misguided as his opinion is.  But this situation is relatively unprecedented, as the government hasn't been particularly aggressive in litigating forms of defamation.  To reiterate: a charge/arrest is different from a conviction.  Also, I said you can't *sell* gum. You can openly bring gum into Singapore and chew it as you please. All this asinine bullshit about Singapore being a dictatorship because "you can't chew gum!!" is just unintellectual stupidity spread by people who are convinced that the squalor they live in constitutes a modern civil society.

singapore| NEWater| SINGAPORE—The trial of a teen video blogger charged with disparaging Christians is showcasing Singapore’s struggle to adapt its tradition of censorship to the realities of the digital era.  Sixteen-year-old Amos Yee is the latest online commentator to be prosecuted in the past year, on charges ranging from contempt of court to sedition. The video for which he was charged was posted on YouTube after the March 23 death of the country’s founding ruler, Lee Kuan Yew , and while it mostly concerned Mr. Lee, it also contained unflattering comments about Christians.  Mr. Yee was charged under Section 298 of the Penal Code, which criminalizes publishing material with the deliberate intention of wounding religious feelings. Mr. Yee has challenged the charges in court.  The cases show how the tightly-controlled city-state is struggling to draw the boundaries for what kind of online expression is acceptable and what speech could be a threat to the multiethnic, multireligious nation now that the means to create and disseminate material are available to almost anyone with an Internet connection.  In another case this week, the Media Development Authority, which regulates online content, ordered the suspension of online news portal The Real Singapore for publishing “objectionable” material that it said incited anti-foreigner sentiment. The material varied but was broadly about social issues in Singapore, often criticizing the actions of foreign workers and visitors to the country.  Two editors of the site have been charged by Singapore’s public prosecutor with sedition. They have denied any wrongdoing.  “I think it’s true to say we certainly have more people writing online; people are also clamoring for some things to be censored,” said Bryan Tan, a lawyer specializing in technology at law firm Pinsent Masons MPillay LLP in Singapore. “The alternative media has got a lot more bolder than it used to be.”  Mr. Tan said he had been approached by more than one online publisher since The Real Singapore was suspended, concerned about whether a precedent was being set and under what circumstances authorities might consider prosecution.  “I think we are all struggling to rationalize this,” Mr. Tan said. “Banning the website—that’s the equivalent of the death penalty.”  The Attorney-General’s Chambers declined to comment on questions of media regulation or the continuing cases.  Mr. Yee’s two-day trial concluded Friday at the State Courts in front of a district judge. A verdict and sentence are expected next Tuesday. Mr. Yee is charged with uploading content online that contained remarks with the deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of Christians. If convicted, he could be punished with a jail term of up to three years, a fine, or both.  He is also charged under Section 292(1)(a) of the Penal Code for electronically transmitting an obscene image showing former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher being subservient to Mr. Lee. If convicted of that crime, he could face imprisonment for up to three months, a fine, or both.  A spokesperson from the media regulator said it “believes that freedom of speech is important; indeed, it is enshrined in our constitution. But freedom of speech cannot be unfettered. It must respect our social norms and the sensitivities of our multiracial and multireligious society.”  The late Mr. Lee had said his censorship of the media was justified because he believed it could be a destabilizing force in a vulnerable, small country with a diverse population. Race riots in the 1960s fostered the idea that national harmony wasn't just a priority but a matter of survival. “Press freedom needed to be subordinated to the overriding needs of the integrity of Singapore, and to the primacy of purpose of an elected government,” Mr. Lee said in 1971.  The teenage Mr. Yee is a slim student with messy long hair and rectangular glasses. A prolific YouTube personality, he lectures his audience on politics, movies and social issues with a mixture of wit and obscenity.  The allegedly offending video, “Lee Kuan Yew Is Finally Dead,” discussed the death of Singapore’s first prime minister. As of Friday, it had been viewed more than a million times.  The video is dominated by criticism of Mr. Lee, who Mr. Yee called a “dictator” who “created an environment where his blatant flaws as a leader were hidden because most people were afraid of criticizing him.”  He is being prosecuted for a short segment in which he criticized Christians as being “power-hungry’’ and likened them to Mr. Lee. He is also accused of distributing an obscene image of Mr. Lee.  Mr. Yee said in a statement to the court he was aware the video might generate ill will toward Christians, but felt it was necessary to promote discussion that would be “healthy for positive change to take place in future.”  Mr. Yee’s style has split Singaporeans, many of whom say he should be punished or given psychiatric care. Last week, a member of the public slapped him as he left the court building.  Meanwhile, the two editors of The Real Singapore, one of whom is an Australian citizen, are being prosecuted for eight offenses each under Singapore’s sedition act. A first offense can be punished with a fine not exceeding 5,000 Singapore dollars (US$3,753), imprisonment for up to three years, or both. It is the first time Singapore has prosecuted a foreigner for sedition.  Singapore has previously prosecuted various offenses committed by online commentators. In 2013, it tightened its grip on Internet news sites by requiring those with significant audiences to apply for local licenses and post a “performance bond” of S$50,000.  “This is not a case of the law fundamentally changing but, rather, adapting to the new ways that people create and distribute content,” said Matt Pollins, a digital media lawyer at Olswang Asia LLP in Singapore, who specializes in legal and regulatory issues related to digital content. “Today, as more content is published and distributed online, we can expect to see laws of this kind applied in an online context, too.”| 34| 2015-05-09 08:13:52

worldnews| nubben5| He didn't just say an "opinion" about a public figure. He also made religiously insensitive remarks. If you look at it objectively, people criticise Lee Hsien Loong and Lee Kuan Yew very often, but how often are people actually prosecuted?  The latest one was Roy Ng where he eventually apologised and admitted he made baseless claims.   If you are going to say its perfectly okay to just go around spreading "nonsense" as your opinion, then what do you think of the Westboro Church? I would think society is better as a whole if those people are locked up.  To give you an idea on how ridiculous Amos Yee was, even his own mom made a police report. | 1| 2015-05-08 22:35:51

singapore| SirPalat| Freedom of speech means that you are allowed to speak what ever you want (hence freedom), freedom of speech does not equate to fighting for others to speak freely  I am pretty sure no matter who, be it a edgy teenager or a wealthy adult immigrant, Singaporeans will not take too kindly to any kind of remarks that insults any religion. Furthermore if that successful adult is immature enough to scold Mr Lee just after his passing, i am pretty sure he will be met with the same punishment and opposition that Amos felt.  After years of Singapore education, the term "racial harmony" is ingrained into every Singaporean so much so that an insult to any race or religion publicly and seriously (not as a joke) will surely be faced with the "Amos Yee" treatment    | 0| 2015-05-07 23:34:25

An injunction against an idea put out by a source people trust will probably be met with agreement, not subversive curiosity.

singapore| weird_sg_kid| Freedom of speech has never been a thing in Singapore. If people cared, there'd be more backlash against incidents like these or worse, the Internal Security Act which allows indefinite detention without trial.  The fact that support for freedom of speech is still rather niche shows that the majority of the population isn't ready for it.  EDIT: To those who didn't understand what "not ready" means: Freedom of speech means you must be willing to fight for the right for others to speak their mind, even if you vehemently disagree with them. The majority of the population seems to take the opposite stance; that Amos Yee deserves to be reprimanded or punished (lightly).

singapore| validpoints| So what would you call his crime?    Would you have the SPF arrest everyone who makes a hateful comment on the internet?  Would you arrest anyone who uses clickbait or sensationalism?  If the justification for criminalizing speech is that it is disruptive to a stable society, then expunging the person doing the speaking and taking away their mouthpiece (shutting down their website and forcing them to flee the country) should be enough of a solution right?  The vindictive part is not allowing him to see his dying father for fear that he would leave and the Singaporean authorities wouldn't be able to publicly punish him.  edit: The authorities don't care about justice or a punishment fitting the crime or solving a social ill.  They want to make an example out of him to dissuade others from operating alternative news sites.  This is the same as Amos Yee, the law they use to punish is written under the guise of social harmony and respect for religious beliefs, but they wouldn't have brought that law to bear against them if they hadn't also run afoul of the authorities through criticism.    | 0| 2015-05-06 13:25:47

The truth is that the majority of the people actually support the oppressive laws. And the Government exists to execute the will of the people.  &gt; 16 year old Amos Yee facing 3 years in jail.  It seems the vast majority of Singaporeans are willing to throw free speech out of the window at the first sign of offence. The government is not needed. Amos Yee was actually attacked by a member of the public outside the court house. My parents, and most of my friends on Facebook actually says he deserves it.  &gt; Gay sex is technically illegal but is never enforced  I actually think this is best compromise for now. It's just like USA had to appease the South by not abolishing slavery during independence, and France took 5 Republics to get it right. Give Singapore some time. After all, we have only been independent for less than 50 years.  The Singapore population as a whole is still very conservative, and there are very strong and organised anti-gay Christians and Muslims groups here. A few years back, a Christian group tried to take over a pro-gay organisation. Beyond the Ruling party, we have the main opposition party, which also refused to condemn the retention of 377A during the Penal Code revisions of 377A. The opposition party also boasts the only Member of Parliament to take part in the anti-LGBT  campaign: Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap.  It's kind of sad, when you think that the current ruling party is the "liberal" party in Singapore's politics.  &gt; Highest per Capital Capital punishment  This statistic is very misleading. Most the capital punishment over drugs are not to local Singaporeans but to Foreigners who are trying to smuggle drugs. Thus, if we want to get a true metric, it should be capital punishment per total number of foreign travellers and Singaporeans or something. Given, Singapore is has lots of foreign travellers, this metric goes down quite alot.  Whether drugs and/or capital punishment are right or wrong is another debate. Btw, I support legalization of drugs and keeping capital punishment.  &gt; 2 year conscription  It sucks but you got to do it if you want your country to survive.

Seriously, don't be lame. Like Amos Yee. 'my friends are losers' really? You're putting words into my mouth now?   You seem to want a definition of an average Singaporean. Fair enough; but I can assure you that there are things more than 'the ppl I hang out with and my family' that shape how I think. I work in hospitals, and every single day I deal with your average uncle and aunty who has something to say about the government. Anyone working in a hospital can tell you the same.   And since you've decided to take potshots at my level of maturity, I figure that if you haven't seen anyone talk like that in 'your whole life' (so far), then perhaps you should really go out there and see more of the world. | 2| 2015-05-04 04:18:59
singapore| tjhan| What do you consider politics? Honestly you just sound as childish as the people you are deriding.   "There is no true value in talking about food unless you are looking to become a chef, or are actively changing the food." Sounds silly eh? People talk because they want to vent or influence or circlejerk, who are you to decide what they want to talk about is worthy or not?   Sounds Amos Yee-ish, like "oh my friends are so losers they don't wanna talk about what I wanna talk about, so that must mean they are stupid."   That said, the people you hang out with and your family environment hugely shape what you perceive as the average Singaporean. In my whole life I have never come across anyone who made the TRS-esque retarded comments in real life, yet somehow every article has hundreds of them. | 3| 2015-05-03 23:58:29
singapore| requimrar| It's not really the government for this, but rather the people. Singaporeans have been so indoctrinated by the PAP attitude that they are afraid or unable to accept anything else.  Of course I'll bring up the by now clichéd Amos Yee incident. He's just voicing his opinions, and he fucked up. Everyone fucks up, and he does need to be punished. But the reaction of many Singaporeans isn't that he should be rehabilitated or counselled, but that he should be imprisoned, and I even remember reading a comment saying "I hope he gets raped in the ass!"  As Singaporeans I think we're too unwilling to accept other viewpoints. Any criticism of the PAP is met with harsh responses of "ungratefulness" or something along those lines.  This needs to change -- sure, the government can abolish all the acts that restrict freedom of speech, like the sedition act or whatever. But if the people are still unable to accept or at least understand someone's opinion without resorting to hate speech, then it's no use.          I have one more gripe -- national "service". Why do I put that in quotes? Because it's really just a waste of everyone's time and money. I'm of the opinion that, in the event of any invasion or attack on Singapore, we're all fucked unless one of our allies comes to our aid -- possibly Australia or the US. Let's face it -- it's unlikely that a bunch of uncles would be able to defend us against an incursion.  What this means of course is that Singaporean makes have their minds dumbed down for two of the most valuable years of their lives. Maybe this is the government's idea of a level playing field, I dunno. I've had a senior of mine come out of NS dumb as a fucking rock. In short, it's a huge waste of time and resources, for no citizen-facing benefit.  The government likes to tout 'deterrence' as a strategy for keeping Singapore alive -- fair enough. But deterrence isn't a million soldiers, only 70k of which are full time, the rest being middle aged men of varying aptitude. It's the fact that our military is technologically superior, and that we have quite a number of allies. There's no point forcing patriotism down the throats of disgruntled teens who are put at a disadvantage -- if they love their country, they'll sign up.  Sorry for the long rant, I really hate NS.| 9| 2015-05-03 14:20:54
singapore| piptheboy| what I dislike about Singapore? oh i could write a whole essay on that.   In short, I dislike the fact that Singaporeans keep dissing the government. By that, I mean the volume, and the time we spend shoving 'PAP SUCKS' down our friends' throats. True, people all over the globe hate their governments too, but 70% of the time the Singaporeans I meet who have much to say about the government can churn out nothing but myopic, biased views against the all-almighty PAP. If you have legit and logical viewpoints, good on you, and you can go on talking about politics with your friends. I won't be your friend though, that's for sure.   The issues we face in SG are not unique to SG, and I think most people fail to understand that.   Let me tell you what I hate. I fucking hate the people of Singapore. I hate myself too, maybe just less. Now look, this is my opinion, and if you don't want to see it, just don't bother reading.    Singaporeans are too damn conservative and apprehensive of anything that is different. Sure, this has done us well if you measure our success with economical yardsticks. Culture-wise? We fall flat on our faces. When I was abroad (for a short stint) I had no choice but to learn how to skateboard to my workplace because of the distance. I brought that habit back to SG because it's more convenient to skate &lt;10 min, than spend 20min walking from the nearest bus stop to my place.   Guess what, I get shot with disapproving looks everywhere I go. What, just because I'm carrying a skateboard and I dress my age, with worn out chuck taylors and some holes in my skate pants?   Gap years. Why do we frown upon young souls who want to take gap years to explore the world for themselves? Did you know that of the graduating A level batch in Germany, up to about 30% of them take gap years, and such experiences actually confer them excellent advantages in their jobs?   We are afraid of striking up small conversations with strangers, even if it's just a simple 'good morning', or a 'hi, yup do you want this seat because you look like you're carrying so many things?' We'd rather shoot each other awkward glances, stand up and walk away pretending like we are getting off the next stop, though we actually just want to give our seat to someone else. Why? Is the video you are watching or the music you're listening to really that interesting? Are you afraid to talk to a fellow Singaporean?  One last thing: Singaporeans are excellent at over-analyzing things and making issues seem way more extreme than they really are. Perhaps it's a good thing sometimes, I can't say for sure. But when I see people talking about how Amos Yee is a failure of SG education, and the SG government etc etc...seriously? He is a teenager who is still growing up, forming his own views of the world around him, and he fucked up. Don't we all? the idiot who slapped him has issues, because he is a grown man slapping a kid. And that is wrong, i think all of us agree on that.   Gosh, if I have anything constructive to say here, it is this - please, be the change you want to see in Singapore. LKY has moved on, and it is truly our turn to write the next chapter. Don't expect some super talented politician to come along again anytime soon and bring us to nirvana. It isn't going to happen. It starts with us becoming better Singaporeans caring about people beyond ourselves, and having sensible discussions about our country that extend beyond the fucking PAP and MPs.   Nobody owes Singapore a living. We find our own way to survive and prosper, turning challenge into opportunity. And surviving/prospering isn't compatible with just empty complaints all the time.         | 21| 2015-05-03 13:19:24
singapore| neatoli_| It may be harmless, but it is a malicious joke about the assault on Amos Yee.

singapore| mayotoast| I agree with over sensitive part at those fb users making statement about going to boycott etc. No need for boycott since its pr suicide to be deemed as condoning physical attack on someone, even if he is amos Yee. Two wrongs doesn't make one right. | 2| 2015-05-02 14:43:08
singapore| IE2140| Conspiracy theory? To victimise Amos Yee| 0| 2015-05-02 01:22:47
singapore| 37phonehome| Well, it really depends - the blog post or video impacted more than 1 million people, and the potential to do damage can be said to be far greater than the personal assault which only impacted Amos Yee. It's not merely a "blog post that hurt people's feelings", even though that may be your opinion. Objectively it's a video which was capable (i'm not saying it did) of causing real social disharmony and distress to persons, and posting this online can be a crime if found guilty (look up Koh Song Huat Benjamin, doing this 10 years before amos yee made it cool). It could definitely be argued that posting offensive words online is more severe. Just pointing out that it's definitely not as simple as you make it seem.| -14| 2015-05-01 22:06:47

singapore| lee_guan_you| &gt; there's always that 0.0001% chance that he might be putting up a show in cahoots with the "victim".  That's not the point. "allegedly" is used here because the identity of the attacker has yet to be confirmed by the authorities. Even if your suggestion that Amos Yee might have been in cahoots with his attacker turns out to be true, the fact remains that Amos Yee *was* attacked by the man. | 2| 2015-05-01 20:30:12
singapore| Cataplexic| Looking at my comment I realise it was poorly phrased and conveys a meaning almost opposite of my intended one. Specifically, about the use of the word "punish". In reality, I really don't think either of them should be punished with jail or flogging, or what-have-you.    In fact, how I view these two individuals' actions - and what I have thought of Amos Yee for weeks - is as anti-social behaviour that really should be dealt with by counseling and education. **When I used the word punish, I basically mean "whatever action the courts want to take". In other words, the OFFICIAL action that the govt takes, whatever that may be**  To try to convey my original meaning, I think both are irresponsible acts that relate more to youthful angst and naive perceptions. I don't believe for a second that either one of these individuals are truly dangerous to society, so when I say:  &gt;an ideal society condemn, deal with and/or punish them equally,   I'm saying that I see their similarity as misguided individuals who aren't beyond reaching. I definitely don't believe that either individual deserves to have a black mark on their criminal records for the rest of their lives over their respective actions.  I do see physical assault as the more serious of the two, as I said, because of the violence involved.  Communist china sucks balls.  Edit: Formatting| 0| 2015-05-01 11:42:22
singapore| RayZR| I suspect this will be buried towards the bottom, but I think this entire episode is an important fight for freedom of speech and the concept of civil discourse.   I do think that Amos Yee needs to learn a lesson or two about humility, civility, respect, and filial piety.  And while I do not condone this act of violence exacted upon Amos Yee and hope that this guy in the red shirt faces the consequences of striking Amos, I find it hard to conjure up any sympathy.| 3| 2015-05-01 11:01:23
singapore| Igortheinvincible| No society should seek to punish our censur anyone for having a different opinion. It's just a transparent attempt at silencing legitimate criticism. If there's no legitimacy to the criticism, then there's no harm in letting it be uttered freely.   To compare Amos Yee, who took the time to collect his thoughts and project these in an orderly, perhaps offensive, fashion, to someone physically assaulting someone on the street, is nothing short of ridiculous.   Your definition of an ideal society sounds and awful lot like communist China or modern day Russia, neither of which are societies one should wish to emulate. | 9| 2015-05-01 03:36:12
singapore| Cataplexic| &gt;It's just a matter of a juvenile adult having insufficient self-discipline to control his frustration at being presented with a view he disagrees with.  You just perfectly described my opinion of Amos Yee himself! If you ask me, an ideal society would condemn, deal with and/or punish them equally.  Although I'd say willingness to physically assault probably is a tiny bit more serious..| -6| 2015-05-01 03:11:04

( insult race) Nothing much. A kid just as old as Amos Yee, beats up foreign workers to "test" his fighting skills ( Violent conduct) , "aiya NS will man him up la. " BUT post a YouTube video insulting LKY and Jesus, suddenly this SIXTEEN yr old kid deserves to be thrown into jail, to have his dick cut off and to be punished in the harshest possible way.   I mean cmon guys, isnt the whole country really reacting too strongly to sth like this? Where was this slapper when the kid who beat up foreign workers was being charged? I think we are giving amos yee exactly what he wants. He probably thinks he is like the "joker" now and goes to sleep with a wideee smile.   Once this ordeal is over for him, if he migrates over to US, this kid has a brightt future guys. Lets be more kind and stop reacting so strongly to whatever he does. | -2| 2015-05-01 02:42:02

For negative consequences, how about having the [hudud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudud) implemented for a change? The guy who slapped Amos Yee should have his right hand cut off.  &gt; But an idiot with an idea will not be concerned with jail terms and fines.  It hasn't worked for dissenters in the past, but history in court has shown that as the stakes are raised against dissenters here the dissenter will finally relent and give in to the state.

singapore| fierysnow| bit late to the party i suppose but - for all those criticising the people for just taking videos and not doing anything, really, what do you want them to do?  i mean if you put yourself in their shoes, and you saw someone, even if not Amos Yee, getting slapped somewhere, you'd just be 'oh wow wtf that person just got slapped'. you most definitely wouldn't go and chase down the slapper for 'justice'.  also, what do you expect them to do? at the very most the average person would just ask the person who got slapped 'are you okay?' it's not like he fell down, fainted, or was bleeding, something that necessitates some sort of action on the part of bystanders.  all of you might take the moral high ground after watching the clip, but most of you would've reacted the same way if you were there.   to be clear, i'm not condoning the slapping incident - i don't think it's right for violence, especially in a case like this. but stop blaming the people that take the videos. furthermore, most of them are journalists - it's their *job* to catch such stories.| 9| 2015-05-01 00:15:58
singapore| tsukuruu| &gt; the vast majority of people are saying that the red dude was clearly in the wrong  It's not a matter of who is right or who is wrong. The title of the link itself speaks a lot about the author too. There's a [handful](https://www.facebook.com/FabricationsAboutThePAP/videos/835855479803795) who are supportive of the red dude. If there's any indicator of what our manners are in light of this, it has to be the red dude and the ensuing reaction on the Internet (i.e. commenters applauding the act).  I honestly think that the red dude was a representative of the repressed feelings of Internet commentators who believe that vigilante justice should be served. Now that vigilante justice is served, now what? After the euphoria, will we start to relook at how we want to present ourselves to the world at large, especially when we prefer to use our online avatars as a refrain?  &gt; If its some connotation in the word 'bitch slap' that you disagree with  I thank you for your kind definition. It is condescending arguments like this that raises definitions that is atypical of our discourse in our discussions. It's pretty much like receiving a bitch slap myself, followed by a "DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH???" Especially when it comes from the Oxford Engrish Dictionaries (misspelling intentional).  &gt; hypercritical navel gazing  For a city state that lacks public discourse, I think our discourse has eventually evolved into a private faultfinding self-centeredness (if that is what you mean by the above). Since we are taught that rioting is bad, everything that is good has to be passivity. Since we choose to live in that dichotomy, something's gotta' give.  So the red dude gave Amos Yee a tight slap. The reporters, as observed in the video, moved away and looked on because *newsworthy*. Bravo.| -5| 2015-05-01 00:15:26

Maybe she is Christian and was insulted but he is in court for that already so she should respect the judicial system.  The way I see it people here fear him because he does not comply and that does not compute in parts of this society it seems. 95% of Singapore had never heard of him before this circus.| 4| 2015-04-30 21:33:00

Sympathy ≠ encouragement. I'm not saying he should do more of what he's doing. I'm saying that if we want to change his behavior, we have to start by understanding what drives it. "Correcting" behavior with sticks and disincentives is superficial, and only works as long as you can enforce it.  &gt;  you're goddam right its "haha lol 16 yr old fucking up his life whateverz~~"  Okay.  &gt; because its extremely hypocritical to just single out amos yee as a troubled youth who needs help and not extend that recognition to the tons of other kids out there who think and behave in much the same way, sans critical stance and faux accent. school dropouts? gang members? pregnant teens? or do we not look at them in the same light because they lack amos' eloquence and daring?

We need to acknowledge that there is a pressing need for a safe space in the Singapore internet community. A safe space where netizens can express their opinions freely without fearing for their own safety, and where there will be trigger warnings posted in order to prevent people from accessing content that they find insulting/demeaning/unsafe in general.   This is more than just freedom of speech - which, by the way, is a privilege that ought to be checked regularly - it is about the use and abuse of online privileges.

singapore| tsukuruu| &gt; Free speech has to be practiced responsibly and be about sharing beneficial ideas or views and backed by truth, science, reason and evidence. But it also should in no way be stopped from being used when criticizing a legitimately bad government, lifestyle or any other topic if the author so believes it as long as empirical evidence is provided.  An argument made is always subjected to biasness even if it is backed by truth, science, reason and evidence. Even if the evidence is staring right in your face, we will tend to succumb to fallacies. Freedom of speech as a concept is no better.  Unless we want to live in a singular society where there ~~can only be one~~ is either right or wrong, I think the way forward is to recognize the plurality of perceptions. Amos Yee is a good test of that plurality, especially at a juncture when as Singaporeans we collectively tend to be passive.  There is really no right or wrong freedom of speech. It's just how society wants to define it. Then again, if a number of us on /r/singapore wishes to be moral crusaders and declare the black-and-white of freedom of speech, then so be it. We'll just have to make do with a narrower path ahead.| 0| 2015-04-28 15:56:04
singapore| meep_feep| amos yee is arrogant because he is so sure of what he is saying that anyone who disagrees is stupid in his opinion. elitism is when you go beyond that and discriminate against entire groups of people by having this attitude that you are superior because of your wealth, power, or intellect. There is an element of social stratification that is not obvious in arrogance alone. There was another post here comparing the elite uncaring face blogger to Amos, the former is elitist and the latter is arrogant.

I think /u/lolnoob1459 mentioned it was a stereotype because he felt that those guys lived up to the typical matrep hooligan image. Amos yee was obnoxious, and if being obnoxious is typically Chinese, then people will say "typical Chinese".  But I agree, they shouldn't be representative of their whole communities because I believe this behaviour is mostly a product of reckless youthfulness.

When a Malay or Indian does something despicable, somehow they are tarnishing their entire communities.   In contrast (for example), nobody says anything about the fact that Amos Yee is Chinese.  It can be a little exhausting.| 47| 2015-04-28 10:35:38

singapore| notbeforelong| I agree with you. The basis of free speech is simply to create constructive discussion. The whole ideology of the freedom of expression can be attributed to John Stuart Mill or at least his literature kickstarted the whole process, where he outlines the need for freedom of expression but also says that there should be limits where he draws the line at with the intention to harm others.    With regards to the whole Amos Yee incident, he had the intention to harm others by making those comments.   I just feel that the term free speech is thrown about very loosely nowadays especially in Singapore. My whole tiff is that people throw that term around without knowing the full meaning of it and our constitution actually allows the freedom of expression but draws lines where harm to certain groups can be caused.   I think the reason why people censor themselves in real life is because they know that if they say certain things that may cause harm to others, they will also receive harm from others. Making disparaging comments online gives people a sense of security because the people they are causing harm to are not right in front of them.| 2| 2015-04-26 06:00:21
singapore| Apparatus404| Yeah. I constantly say I'm mildly disappointed by the people. I used to be all "we need to change the government!" Many years ago. But then I realised that while the government isn't a very fair democracy in the western sense, it still reflected the people.  After the little india riots, so many people were calling for tough action and the alcohol ban for little india. Come on. Really. Why. And now we've got a curfew countrywide. Damn it. And then you've got the gay penguins book that got passed through MDA and placed in a Library but enough Singaporeans wanted it banned. So it's gone. And you've got that Adultery site, and people wanted to ban that too.  And then Amos Yee came up and people were yelling for "Justice" .  And there's also STOMP. That shitty ass website. I've had friends from Europe come over, and they asked if it's okay to smoke in a certain area. I didn't know how to tell them that it was legally fine, but since this was a posh looking place and no one else was smoking, I'd have no idea if they would end up on STOMP.   I was more worried about People than the Government. How shitty is that?  It's not the government that needs change. We need to change as a society. Even if you changed the government, and you replaced the people. You're still replacing them with people from this society. You'll get the same thing.   .. so.. urgh. It's depressing.| 4| 2015-04-26 02:29:58
singapore| junnies| the state is an organisation given legal power to use violence over the people living under it. we should therefore be extremely careful about the sort of violence we permit the state to inflict. the idea of free speech stems from the reluctance of the people to allow the state to control their thoughts and speech through violence.   what sort of speech should a state be given legal permission to punish people for? in theory, one can say 'bad speech/hate speech/ no evidence, unreasonable, unscientific speech should be banned. in practise, it is unpopular speech, or speech critical of the state (and those that hold power within it) that is punished. since controlling speech is so susceptible to abuse (see history everywhere including singapore), the principle of free speech is introduced and held in high esteem in order to allow people to speak without fear of state violence.   ***  you seem to think its relatively simple and feasible to divide speech into 'good' speech and 'bad' speech. if you have held any seriously dissenting or controversial view before (guessing by your naivety, you have not), you'd understand the difficulty. some of the stupidest and fraudulent ideas are 'scientific' and 'reasonable', and vice versa.  take any belief you personally have that you believe to be the most controversial/dissenting. now imagine that there are laws that punish you for expressing it. maybe you think homosexuality is a sin. in some societies, you would be punished for holding and expressing that view. maybe you think homosexuality is not a sin. in some societies, you would be punished for holding and expressing that view.  essentially, freedom of speech is the principle that 'because speech is so subjective, and we don't want the state to inflict violence on us for expressing our views, we collectively decide that it is better that the state punishes no one for expressing their views.'  ***  amos yee, a sixteen year old, made some silly and offensive remarks. some singaporeans saw him as a sinner, some westerners see him as a hero. the same video and same remarks, but people have different subjective views. who are you to say which view is 'good' or 'bad'?  my view? don't make a fuss out of nothing. if you (not OP specifically, but society in general) can't handle amos yee, you're probably not ready to participate in serious critical thinking. serious critical thinking involves dissent, disagreement, and sometimes controversy. the same kind that gets you jailed in some places, sometimes| 6| 2015-04-26 01:53:00

singapore| mknecht24| &gt;Ever since the whole Amos Yee case it kind of sparked something in me. I would like to question whether the internet community really truly understands the concept of free speech and the freedom of expression, whether you defended Amos or criticized him.  IMO, the majority of the internet community in Singapore does not truly understand the concept of the *Internet* -yet-. Nobody *forced* anyone to watch the video or read his blog. If you don't like it, stop watching it. And stop sharing his video on Facebook if you so dislike what he said.    Its not about responsible free speech. Public free speech is not the same as Internet free speech. Its because most of Singaporeans grew up, lived in a generation where media is highly censored and told what to read, what to hear, what to say. When they are exposed to the Internet, they don't know how to react to such situations| 4| 2015-04-26 00:44:33
singapore| daveonhols| Pretty sure it is your understanding of free speech that is not correct. You can argue against freedom of speech all you want, bbut that doesn't change the essence of what freedom of speech actually is.   The idea that the state should enforce laws requiring only "beneficial" speech is pretty dangerous and is likely to be abused by the state for nefarious reasons.  So for example in Singapore, LKY can call Chee Soon Juan a pshycopath, or the papers can say CSJ wants to lead an illegal protest march, and there are no repercussions, but if someone says something the government doesn't like or finds controversial, they can get sued and people say you need proof before you can speak.  Also, I disagree with your idea that "the whole point of contention" about Amos Yee was his remarks about religion. I am sure it was mostly / entirely a result of his criticising LKY. You can see this in the remarks of his critics.| 19| 2015-04-26 00:37:44
singapore| neatoli_| No one AFAIK is saying that Amos Yee should be shielded from all consequences because "muh free speech rights". If there are people doing that out there, it's a pretty weak argument that justifies nothing. A lot of what Amos said in the video was juvenile nonsense.  We shouldn't keep harping on the definition of free speech and its pitfalls when the issue really isn't about free speech in the first place.  In Singapore, you'd be hard pressed to find someone who sincerely thinks that we champion free speech in this country. Most people are fine with the idea that unfettered free speech should not exist in Singapore. We all already know that there are **consequences** for any action you take. The question is, can we agree on what these consequences should be? This is why Amos Yee's case is controversial, because some people viewed the backlash towards him as disproportionate.   edit for phrasing| 11| 2015-04-26 00:26:41
singapore| lordKappa| &gt; Yes, and I'm asking you why we shouldn't believe what this blog post says.

singapore| Dreamwaltzer| Just because someone says something un popular does not mean they have broken the law. It might be bad PR, it might cause some people to get fired, but its not illegal.   *oh but why did poor widdle Anus Wee get caught!*  gawdzillar mentioned what offenses Amos yee is getting charged with [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/33gcr2/discussion_amos_yee_v_wee_shu_min/cqknpl8)   Now, here are some things you need to realize.  Anus Wee is not guilty. Why? He has not been sentenced yet. He got charged with 3 offences, he got released on bail, and that's basically it. A bit of a scandal when his parents didnt want to post bail for him but he eventually got bailed out. Remember, its innocent until proven guilty, not innocent until proven guilty or unpopular.   So why is Anus Pee being treated differently? That's a more interesting question, because we know that 20 police reports got raised against him. How many were raised against this other girl? And butthole Yee is also more guilty of breaking laws. Posting a buttfucking image on facebook, not the wisest of things. You can say that the claims of harassment, or intent to stir discontent are debatable, but he got really screwed by the buttfuck imge. Whether he really is guilty of the other stuff is up to the courts to decide so I'll leave it as that.    On a side note, its amusing that if you insult the whole of singapore, its fine. But if you insult one race or religion of Singapore, thats sedition and thats bad. A bit of a flawed loophole there I think...   And lastly, why the fuck would the father be made to step down as MP? Simply because his daughter said something you didn't like? It's bad enough the government is oppressing our freedom, lets not make it more confusing by trying to oppress our MP's. | 0| 2015-04-22 18:30:27
singapore| gawdzillar| Just to add on info. Amos Yee is facing 3 charges.  1) &gt; Uttering words, etc., with deliberate intent to wound the religious or racial feelings of any person     298.  Whoever, with deliberate intention of wounding the religious or racial feelings of any person, utters any word or makes any sound in the hearing of that person, or makes any gesture in the sight of that person, or places any object in the sight of that person, or causes any matter however represented to be seen or heard by that person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years, or with fine, or with both.  2) &gt; Sale of obscene books, etc. &gt;  292.—(1)  Whoever — (a) sells, lets to hire, distributes, transmits by electronic means, publicly exhibits or in any manner puts into circulation, or for purposes of sale, hire, distribution, transmission, public exhibition or circulation, makes, produces, or has in his possession any obscene book, pamphlet, paper, drawing, painting, representation or figure, or any other obscene object whatsoever;  3) &gt; Harassment, alarm or distress  &gt; 4.—(1)  No person shall by any means — (a) use any threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour; or (b) make any threatening, abusive or insulting communication,  Not sure if Wee had anyone report her to the police, which seems like a very big difference between the cases. Yee was reported and the police decided to take action and there are laws regarding what he did, so legally it was possible to charge him. The Christian bit being a pretty big deal (we have so many stories of bloggers getting charged in court for racist comments). Another thing, the harassment act is pretty new, passed in 2014, if you guys remember from the Xiaxue saga (she used it too), so i guess that is another new bit.   If we were to take Wee's case, she would probably be none of the same charges. Possibly could be defamation but if you were the blogger would you sue her father for defamation?| 10| 2015-04-22 17:43:39

I see a [black and white fallacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqz53d-fYL8) here. A police patrol goes around while you walk around at night is something that can experienced the world over, but the feeling of safety is merely a perception.  &gt; Where else can you do that, without having to worry about getting robbed or killed?  Safety is not exclusive to Singapore. Even in places with the highest instance of robberies and killings, merely having kids playing in the streets at night is safety itself.

singapore| Quarkeey| You seem to not be reading my post.  &gt;A wishy washy government that won't say no to idiots decrying them shows what kind of people they are overall.  Free speech to the nth degree, is a symptom. Not a cause.  We are all free to speak in this country.  Free to speak the truth.  What we are not free to do, is slander.  A government that would hear Amos Yee insult it with selective statistics, bearing no mind to the care put into sectors other than the ones he felt were needed, a government scared to stop the radicals that would rather incite hatred and offense rather than reasoned discussion, all under the ground of free speech.  That is a government that I would never want to live under.  Because at the end of the day, the Singapore Government has not taken away any of your rights, nor mine, except the right to be a nuisance.  I am not a christian. But those who are and claim not to be offended by insults to their god, simply do so because their belief in their religion is outstripped by their belief in their political views.

singapore| neatoli_| Perhaps I should have been clearer and used a better choice of word(than stringent) - Amos has violated bail before and may do so again. I'm agreeing with you that he has trouble stopping himself from posting things online and there's even a possibility that he might rebel by not cooperating with the police. The authorities would easily have reason to judge Amos to have forfeited bail if he doesn't follow the court orders to the letter, which he is apt to do given his personality. I think you're reading too much into a cursory statement of mine - I'm not implying any ill intent on the part of the authorities in setting an overly onerous bail condition(which everyone can judge for themselves), neither am I making any "argument".  I'm trying to highlight the bravery of the counsellor because he is willing to risk Amos Yee forfeiting bail *again*.| -2| 2015-04-22 00:47:27
singapore| ayam| I think trying to compare him to jihadists is quite a stretch.   Anyway, there are plenty of videos like that out there right now. So it's not a matter of should we allow or should we not allow, we are in no position to dictate anything. Instead of trying to create a sterile environment, we should learn how to decide for ourselves, what is good and what is not. Does one become a jihadist after viewing their message of hate? Does reading Mein Kampf turn one into a brown shirt? If you do, then you are probably not a very good person to start with. You cannot sanitize the world. The next best thing is that you should be exposed to the best and the worst, so you can tell what's right and what's wrong. Would you prefer someone else to tell you that the new Star Wars movie is crap and you cannot watch it, or would you like to be the judge of that and see for yourself?   Amos Yee made a horrible video, but you decided to see it anyway. Did that turn you into a LKY hater? Most probably not. If anything, it polarized your opinion to the exact opposite.   Back to your example, if my parents died and random dude starts to make videos and be all rude, I can choose not to see it. Now harassment is when this dude starts emailing me those videos. Did Amos send you his videos? Or did you click on a link that someone else shared? Perhaps you should be mad at them for spreading such garbage. Hey look, I found something horrid that absolutely disgusted me, wanna see? Chances are, your curiosity got the better of you, everybody loves to see a train wreck.    What is an appropriate treatment for him then? Not jail, not fines. He should be getting counseling and learn how to respect people in their time of mourning. He should learn that whatever LKY did, he was also someone's father, someone's brother, someone's grandfather. It's not about censoring one's thought, but about being sensitive to the emotions of others. | 3| 2015-04-21 23:20:08
singapore| nubben5| If you say his treatment is disproportionate for his actions, what do you think is an appropriate treatment for his actions? A fine? Or nothing?  And to give you an alternative viewpoint, what if it was my your parents that died, and suddenly this random guy starts making videos celebrating his death and making insensitive remarks. Would you classify that as harassment? If something like that happened to me, you can be sure I'll be going to the police.  While I believe everyone, including Amos Yee, can and should have their own opinion, they shouldn't be going around to express their opinion in a way that is designed to provoke. Otherwise where do you draw the line? Should we allow jihadist to just go around spreading their message of hate and protect it as "freedom of speech"?| 0| 2015-04-21 22:32:40
singapore| neatoli_| &gt; There's a real need for supporters of Amos to clarify:  &gt;Is he a young child who has been immature in his youthful exuberance and hence should not be punished like an adult for breaking a law (albeit quite harsh one)  &gt;Or is he a mature individual with strong well-reasoned intelligent arguments who rightly should then face the consequences of his actions in a court of law?  &gt;Seems like these supporters want to have their cake and eat it too... He can't be both, can he?  I think there's a real need to clarify here. People who think that Amos is being subjected to unusually harsh punishment (he is a 16 year old boy after all) are NOT the same as people who "support" his view. I feel you are introducing a false dichotomy by conflating the two groups. You can believe that Amos Yee is rude, vulgar, holds unrealistic and delusional views, AND at the same time also believe that the punishment he is facing is excessive.| 36| 2015-04-21 21:53:51

singapore| macritchies| I guess first and foremost was that he put forth his points in a really crude manner that relied only on provoking emotions rather than facts (even if there *were* facts, he didn't present them). And that, together with him mocking LKY, rubbed a lot of wrong shoulders. Of course people would be mad.   But I think the author here brings up two really good points:  1) Singaporeans don't debate nearly enough. Anything that we don't agree with, we go straight to the authorities or higher-ups instead of researching it, understanding it and arguing for our point. It's not just that freedom of speech is being curtailed, but that it's not being practised in the first place; the Internet's got plenty of avenues for discussion but no one's *really* using it. Not a lot of commentary going on. Maybe people are afraid? Can't be bothered to think? Idk.   2) Singaporeans have a mentality of "Teacher, he make me!". Instead of solving our own problems we tend to either a) blame it on the gah-men, or b) get the gah-men to solve it. I'd say even as young kids we were like this. Whiny brats complaining to our teacher/mother/father/grandmother/grandfather whenever something goes wrong. And it's manifested itself like this too, I think. So if someone (read: 20+ people) doesn't like what Amos Yee is saying, instead of, for example, publishing a commentary on how valid/invalid his points are or how crude he's being and what that spells for society and why it's good/bad, they report it to the police. (Then, the police has to do something about it, or their authority can be seen as undermined.)  TL;DR Combination of locals not willing to argue/debate/discuss/speak up/think critically (?) + always relying on higher-ups instead of taking an active approach + narrow-mindedness (hive mentality? maybe?).| 4| 2015-04-21 20:55:55

singapore| Dreamwaltzer| &gt; One might find Amos offensive. One might find him annoying, rude, arrogant, vulgar and disrespectful. One might thoroughly dislike him. One might actively choose to avoid him if caught in a social situation together. And that’s perfectly fine. No one is required to like Amos.  &gt;But all of that is completely separate from the fact that in Singapore, you can be reported and arrested for being offensive and annoying and rude and vulgar and disrespectful. That you can be charged for harassment despite the fact that no one was forced to watch your YouTube video (everyone who was distressed by the video could have, at any point, closed the browser and gone on with his or her life). That it can be a criminal offence, in Singapore, to say things that people don’t like to hear.   This really stands out to me.   This whole case puts me in a tiny bit of a dilemma. On one hand, I support free speech, and this whole incident just shows how little free speech you have in Singapore.  On the other hand, I really hate Amos Yee and I hope he gets bum fucked by a pineapple.  | 23| 2015-04-21 18:45:53

singapore| czxcjx| Why is it that with every comment I see, I realize that no one at all is treating him like an other distinct human being from themselves? Either he's a caricature to be hated or he's the new 'boy revolutionary' that we can all pile our freedom of speech ideologies on, or he's the 'poor kid' that needs another chance with significant mental help through the relevant institutions. Not a single person at all (except maybe Alfian Sa'at, who posted a post telling people to stop psychoanalyzing him) actually cares about the issue except for what they can use out of him in their own agendas.  You know people have been slinging around this laden term of 'free speech', and some guy even brought out the constitution and pointed out that free speech is still tied to civil duties and all that crap. In the end the whole philosophical context for the idea is borne from two concerns, which are Empathy and Viable Discourse.  The first involves not taking a hardline approach towards individuals because you suppose that these individuals have their own faculties and contexts that we cannot understand. Like Freedom of Religion and all that stuff, different means of worship, and different types of beliefs that, if they do not overstep on bounds like murder or rape or other crimes that are directly inflicted on other humans, they can be sanctioned by the state to be practised freely. No one who decided to cast a stone at Amos, and even very little of those who rose as his shield afterwards, ever considered him as a person with a faculty and a context different from their own. They castigated a living breathing complex human being from a single slice of an 8 minute video that clearly doesn't capture the full length and breadth of his character. Now of course I know some of you are trying to think of how to turn this argument on the other end, like saying that Amos too lacks empathy because he doesn't consider the contexts of the people watching his videos. Firstly Youtube is a public space and the only direct attacks he had towards a distinct individual was towards LKY, who, as a public figure, should not be EXEMPT from such critique because he's also a representative of state policies. In fact that's my whole gripe with the funeral as well, that the whole grieving thing was less about the death of LKY than it was the 'Death of Singapore', with everyone projecting their sorrow towards a loose outline of an individual, while only his closest family members and friends were actually paying their respects to the proper corpse.  But the other argument raised up might be that of Jesus, who because he's seen on the divine terms of the Trinity or the Resurrection and all that stuff, despite being a historical personage, still exists within the context of a Christian framework because they see his form as immortal. Thus an attack upon the historical personage of Christ doubles as an attack on the Divine status of Christ and somehow 'degrades' him into a material status. Well firstly my idea of religion was that it was always about the segmentation of the Divine versus the Temporal, where the Temporal is subjugated by a higher principle. For example Dante in the Divine Comedy characterizes the Empyrean as the sphere of pure light as opposed to the Inferno and the mountains of Purgatory, which are caricatures of our internal 'dirty material' human natures taken to their logical extreme as a form of poetic justice. This would mean though that what is material should have no basis upon conceptions of Divinity, for as the Christian Mystic Swedenborg characterized it, every man crafts his own Heaven and Hell through his own actions. And even in conceptions which include judgment, this judgment is personal per individual and it feels strange that viewing a single Youtube video would somehow drag down one's own soul towards damnation. So lets say that unlike the Desert Fathers, who shunned the material conception of humanity, or those who believe in the idea of divine Beatification through dissolvement of the flesh (cupio dissolvi), your conception is that of the Pandeistic The-Kingdom-Of-God-is-Within-You type of logic. That type of Christianity. Then Amos Yee would be within the framework of divinity as well, viewed through the scope of the trascendent showing itself immanently in the world and nature. Which means that, as per Tolstoy and Gandhi, rather than castigation or violent tendency, what should be done is instead to show compassion and forgiveness since he too reflects the infinite state. Which is exactly why so many Christians signed the petition exempting Amos Yee from the tough arm of the law.  Anyway the above illustration was to show that when it comes to the Divine the levels of perspectives are multiplied a thousandfold dependent on denomination and interpretation so much so that an attack on Christ the personage cannot be said to definitively infringe on anyone's context in the framework of religion. If it was Buddha it would probably be even less of an issue because generally there's all that stuff about the conception of the no-self, Sunyata and the Absolute Nothingness and that whole thing about Life being an Illusion.  And furthermore since violence or any direct form of crime was not sanctioned within the Yee video itself, it doesn't exactly count as a hate-speech but merely a person's own views.  The problem is when people cannot differentiate between what is a direct infringement (on property, on our own health and well-being, or the above for our direct relations) and indirect infringement (the abstract stuff that we're made of, like our personalities, our beliefs, our conceptions of the world). The fact of the world is that everyone only sees things through their own eyes and the Descartian 'I think therefore I am' holds true (even if you try to do all that postmodern bullshit of trying to critique the language itself). What is indirect infringment can only be approximated, which means that the laws should only judge upon the terms of what is a direct infringement of another person's sovereignty of self. That's why we don't sanction immediate arrests against others because when it comes to indirect infringement, the lines that are drawn and what is to be tolerated are always 'hazy' and 'indistinct' and all the fuckers out there who make the claim that "a line must be drawn and we must stop being tolerant" are actually just saying "I should be able to arbitrarily destroy another person's life through the sanction of the government for my own temporal and insignificant sudden passions". Because as psychology has pointed out in recent years we are very very susceptible to the random shit that happens around us and we can break down for no apparent reason other than having some strange idea enter our consciousness. To entrust a definite law to an infringement on our internal belief systems, which are so easily subject to change, and can take up so many interpretations, is definitely the reason why we shouldn't have censorship laws or anything like that, and why the most important thing is to cultivate empathetic society and not provide other people with the tools to arbitrarily bring down someone for something as abstract and hazy as a 'set of beliefs' or 'social code'.  And the other reason, the idea of Viable Discourse, as to why this is important is that we can only approximate the will of the community, and what is democratic, through discourse among people of all levels within society. We tolerate angry viewpoints because if we have no discourse to begin with we cannot BEAR to approximate what another human being is thinking. A person is only known by a finite set of actions and words and accumulating opinion without shutting it down is our way of approximating the reality of the situation around us. If not our society would be shut off in the narrow confines of heinous orthodoxies and we'd perpetuate the same rigid memes throughout the whole. Life like that would be monotonous, rigid and very lonely, because we'd have no sense of anything else but our own small set of exchanges, and the political process will seem like an abstract monstrosity warping our environment in its own unexplainable principles and ways.  With all that being said, I sure as hell bet that none of this is going to get through to anyone and the arbitrary process of persecution is just going to continue on with little hope of change.| 2| 2015-04-19 13:05:53

singapore| j_fat_snorlax| I have been to /r/atheism and frankly, the stuff I see on it isn't nearly as insufferable as everyone else makes it out to be. More often than not, the content on it is about religious bigots, contradictions in religious texts, and support for fellow atheists, rather than baseless religious bashing.  Amos Yee called Jesus &amp; LKY Power hungry and malicious.   Whether or not Jesus has the powers Christians claim he has, few atheists believe that  Jesus may have lived on earth at some point, and even fewer have an opinion on whether he was a good or bad person or what his intentions were because atheists don't really care about what you believe, they care that organised religion spreads ideas they consider absurd that occupy the lives of those who believe them.   As far as I can tell, Amos's claims (about Jesus) are really not the same as the kind of claims you'd find on that subreddit.| 2| 2015-04-18 23:34:21

singapore| tsukuruu| &gt; This isn't a knee-jerk reaction, it's just evidentiary.  What about the Lionel de Souza factor? As much as he flouted bail conditions, the police report made in the lead-up to the pre-trial conference could have had an impact as well. OP is sidestepping this, much preferring cold, hard evidence that the court has brought to Amos Yee for flouting the bail conditions.  If the facts are that simple, then Amos Yee should be in remand without bail. The authorities know full well that there's the possibility of him opening up the posts/videos, but they proceed with [bail](http://www.lawsociety.org.sg/forPublic/YoutheLaw/ArrestBail.aspx) instead of holding him under remand from the very beginning. However, placing him in remand without bail would be highly contentious since this would be a reflection that we are living in an authoritarian state.  All in all we have the general consensus of declaring him guilty even before the court has reached it's final verdict. The local press is having a field day witch-hunting, especially with the [misrepresentation](http://asiancorrespondent.com/132187/singapores-government-linked-media-misrepresents-amos-yees-mother/) of Amos Yee's mother filing a report for her son's arrest.

He'll go into the room, act like a good boy and agree and pledge to change, but after the session he'll go back home and blog about why society should ban counseling on his next youtube video  He needs to learn it the hard way to be able to change, or if not, at least conform and behave. Keep personal thoughts to himself.  If he's really unhappy with living in Singapore, I would suggest that he renounce his citizenship and find another country, where he can rant all he wants. After all, he claims that he is mature and 'smarter' than all us lowly conforming people living in a 'rigid society'. I'm sure he'll be able to survive on his own somewhere out there.| 2| 2015-04-17 11:33:27

Yes, it is unrealistic to expect a dismissal of the charges in court. I think Famous Amos is sticking up for what he believes in. In some ways that is admirable. Most teenagers would be cowed after being arrested by the police who come knocking at night to throw him in a cell for 2 days. The police can be most intimidating to minors, let alone a public enemy like Amos.

From a freedom of speech point of view, I think it's ok for people to speak out against Amos Yee and condemn him, just as Amos has a right to say whatever stupid shit he wants.

singapore| why_do_anything| 1. Influx of foreigners. Leading to greater competition for jobs (or high-paying ones). Then overcrowding, so public transportation has to buck up to accommodate more people particularly during peak hours. Also high demand low supply, cause houses to become more expensive. Which partially contributes to:  2. Ageing population (1st world problem) Too expensive to have kids, and raise them, plus the opportunity cost of that is tremendous. Lack of freedom also. Well, this is a worldwide phenomenon.  3. LGBT. The 377A law that prosecute 'carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman, animal'. And no marriage for them. This brings to mind: religion vs. the LGBT community. IMO, I don't see it changing any time soon.   4. Freedom of speech (for a minority: eg LKY, Amos Yee etc) There's intolerance for people with different views, lifestyle.  5. Education. If our education was less rote, and more on critical thinking, debates etc, I'm sure less people would be 'offended' so easily. At least 15 police report were made over a youtube video. Lol. We need to learn how to disagree with someone without threatening to chop off his genitals and put it in his mouth. And the comment was made by a grassroots leader. Come on, we can do better than that.  You'll notice all of them are social in nature. Personally I'd like to see the G listen to our concerns more, and actually implement effective measures. Instead of ivory tower plans that waste money and reap no or little result. More tolerance, more conversations, more of overcoming problems.   Most pressing? Education IMO. I believe by raising a whole new generation of quality people who are not mindless, aimless, and just interested in money; who can think for themselves, are passionate about smth and pursue it; we can go far.| -4| 2015-04-14 12:55:20

So the video has a metric fuckton of downvotes, and all the comments are personal attacks at Amos Yee and/or stating how much of a great leader Lee Kuan Yew is. Yet there are no actual arguments that go against any of Amos Yee's claims, or why Lee Kuan Yew is such a great leader. "HE WAS A GREAT LEADER YOU MOTHERFUCKER" are basically most of the YT comments yet no one presents reasons why. Seems like a shitload of laziness and denial. | 19| 2015-04-13 11:49:21

I don't think I've come across any locally made videos that mirrors what he says. If anyone else shits on any other religion (Islam/Buddhism/Hinduism) in the same way, I'm pretty sure they will be arrested too.

singapore| oklos| Feels to me like the first paragraph is really trying too hard here:  &gt; The most winsome political dissident you’ve never heard of, Amos Yee, is a Singaporean, a YouTube personality, and an activist who takes his cause more seriously than he takes himself. He has hair like a haystack in late afternoon and the nervous timing of a standup nebbish. He curses as imaginatively as a Scotsman in an Iannucci script, and, despite his perfect vision, he wears glasses on camera, for style. He’s a humanist—a close student of street idiom and indie film—but he has a data wonk’s appreciation for comparative statistics and a wariness of received wisdom. On concerns such as gay rights, income inequality, and free speech, he’s outspoken on the right side of history. He is seventeen years old.  Beyond that stylistic issue, this makes a decent enough point about the usual issues of free speech, with a very sympathetic assessment of Amos Yee's videos (not just the one that got him arrested).  Fails, however, to at all address the historical context for such laws, and immediately assumes that it's there to produce compliant (in his words) "sheeplike complaisance".| 1| 2015-04-11 11:33:15

And in closing: &gt;If anything, Yee has all the hallmarks of a green and thriving mind  imo, criminal matters aside, the whole tragedy of these series of events is that the acts of many Singaporeans will have only made Amos more cynical and less trusting. Many - in their instinctive need to pass judgment - have forgotten that this could easily have passed as just another episode in the story that is the idealism of youth.  Yes eventually youths are humbled by their experiences in life; and in his case, this is probably part of that experience as well, but how depressing - and perhaps hypocritical - it would be if so many of us thought such youthful exuberance is so unnatural and an aberration that warrants death threats.| 41| 2015-04-11 11:23:57

worldnews| NoObOii| So what if you're deeply saddened regarding the loss of Lee Kuan Yew, the fact that you support Amos Yee, a 17 year old teenage kid with frustrations since he's at that age to go to jail shows just how fucked up you are. That you're just a conformist who can't even stand up for your own rights and feel the need to follow what everyone else is saying because you fear being different would make you a social outcast like how everyone has made Amos one because he had different views and opinion.  This kid needs counselling, not jail time.  I don't suppose you've ever stopped to think about what he had to say in his video, the fact that most or some of the things he had said were in fact, the truth. Just because all of your friends are doing it(hating Amos Yee, hoping he goes to jail and sending him death threats), you feel the need to "follow the trend" just so you would gain some sort of acceptance within social media.  Singapore isn't an independent country, it's a monkey-see-monkey-do country. People do what everyone is doing because they're afraid to miss out and don't even realise how corrupt it is, the fact that we have zero freedom of speech, and how the law has that privilege, to speak freely. Grassroots leader Jason 'Cookie' Tan spoke of personally castrating Amos Yee, which is basically criminal intimidation with the intention to hurt someone, yet you don't see him arrested nor having to face a supposed 7 years jail term.| 1| 2015-04-08 01:08:40

singapore| a999999| yes, i am aware of america's hate speech laws, and am generally (though not always) on board with its consecration of the freedom of speech ideal. i was merely addressing your actual example.  &gt; At the end of the day, its some angsty teen blowing hot air ungraciously on a youtube video. All he did was talk. But its good knowing cases like these are usually let off from what you said.  there's no reason for the police to target amos yee in particular. if they really wanted to, they could take down any number of anonymous forum members or high-profile online satirists. but only amos yee: 1) pissed enough people off to have them call the cops on him 2) invoked racial/religious hate speech so that the police HAD to persecute him (like i said, the police have a pretty consistently draconian stance on hate speech).  which is why i'm more inclined to see this whole saga as amos yee being a stupid shit than as an insidious pro-LKY government ploy. whether or not aforementioned hate speech laws are too harsh is another matter on its own; what i'm trying to say is that the authorities are not persecuting him on political grounds.  as a sidenote, i think one of the factors that may colour our different views of amos yee is that americans are generally more sympathetic towards – and indeed expect – adolescent impulsiveness. (not saying this is an invalid viewpoint, am only pointing out different cultural expectations.) whereas the viewpoint of singaporeans is that amos yee is already 17, so he could've expressed his views in a more rational and less offensive manner. (i'm 18 fwiw, and am capable of publicly criticising LKY without pissing off the local Christian population.)| 1| 2015-04-05 06:08:27

Am I missing something?  yes, you're missing the fact that he's ostensibly in court for the anti-christian bit of his very public rant (i think he said some shit about jesus), NOT the lky bit. some find it suspect, but in any case 1) over the years the authorities *have* been very consistent with going after racial/religious hate speech in the name of preventing repeated racial riots, to the point of what some have deemed oversensitivity 2) many others have walked free after publicly insulting lky post-death – some far more acerbically (alfian sa'at), some in an even more gormless manner than amos yee (TRS and co). the religious charges are a thinly-veiled excuse for the pissed-off public to call the cops on amos yee imo, but the authorities have consistent if not valid grounds for going after him.  &gt; Months ago people in my town had Obama signs making him look like Hitler and saying all this obscene shit right outside our towns little post office. I know ive seen people in front of the white house making a mockery of Obama with more racist shit like monkey suits and stuff like that.

singapore| redditor_here| &gt;Similarly, most Singaporeans can recite the 'rags-to-riches / no natural resources except our talent' story of Singapore, but ask most of them a question about operation spectrum, operation coldstore or vincent cheng and most of them will go "what? what? who? what are you talking about?"  You made some really good points, but one thing I have must disagree with is your claim that Singaporeans are oblivious to operation spectrum, operation coldstore, Vincent Cheng, and the many, many other opposition politicians who were locked up by lky. I honestly have not met a single Singaporean who doesn't know about this. They may not know the names of those operations or the names of the politicians, but they do know that many people were locked up without trial for being against the ruling party. Why do you think the older folk still have the mentality that they shouldn't speak ill of the government in public? The public knows of Singapore's dark past, and many of those events still have lasting ramifications on the current mindset in society.   Hell, even during the whole Amos Yee fiasco, people were *expecting* him to be silenced through means of the law. To any Singaporean, there was no way he was going to get away with what he said regardless of our own personal beliefs on freedom of speech. | 8| 2015-04-03 18:35:24
worldnews| None_of_your_Beezwax| &gt; Look, it should be pretty clear by now that we both understand the validity of modus ponens. The validity is not in question; the issue is that it's not very useful, since nobody questions that M.P. is valid, and any discussion would obviously thus center around the acceptability of the premises.  Ah! Yes, but logic (at least first order) cannot be useful if it is valid, by the paradox of analysis.  I do see your point, but I think your objection to my use of Q.E.D. for the reasons you give is miguided because of this principle.  &gt;Put another way: I don't agree that a positivist view of law is ultimately dependent on a moral view, because I see law as a distinct class of values not reducible (even if strongly related) to morality due to its fundamentally social nature and organisational purpose. Loosely speaking, one could point to aesthetics as another example of how value systems are not all dependent on moral values, even if related and even often overlapping.  The problem of circularity persists.  Why do you accept a law?   Is it is because it is right to follow law? Well then you have passed moral judgement.  Is it because it benefits society? Does that mean that it is good for an individual to do what benefits society? Well there you have made a moral judgement.  Why should we strive to the beautiful? Because it is good to strive for the beautiful and the good is just. There's your moral judgement.  It is similar to Socrates' puzzle. Are God's commands good because God is good or because they are God's commands? If the former, then God must subscribe to a higher (moral) law, if the latter then morality is relative and killing babies is always good if God commands it.  Just substitute "The law" for "God" and the same problem appears.   In any event, I would argue that in the long run free speech is the greater good for society and should be protected even at the cost of short run conflict. Obviously the "shouting fire in a crowded cinema" problem arises, but no one has ever died from having their feelings hurt, much less a petty tyrant.  &gt;That is, I'm not so sure that 'managing' versus 'avoiding' conflict would imply leaving cases like Amos Yee or Amy Cheong alone.  If the conflict amounts to no more hurting the people's feelings then they should be given a medal a free coffee at Starbucks for a year.  A little conflicted emotion is good for you and ultimately MUCH better for the political landscape. It is not something to be avoided, much less punished.  &gt;Examples? I'm not being deliberately disagreeable here; I honestly can't recall offhand a case involving such conflict where the party was deliberately prioritised over the national interest. I would agree that the PAP is probably overly paranoid in interpreting cases as a threat to peaceful coexistence, but I'm much more sceptical of the view that the law's purpose is to defend the party rather than the general peace.  "Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable." - John F. Kennedy  By bankrupting opposition leaders and gerrymandering cynically the PAP has ensured that the country is unable navigate any significant change peacefully. Something will come to a head eventually and then it will not be pretty.  Also, constructing a society based on nationalism has never ended well.

worldnews| oklos| Look, it should be pretty clear by now that we both understand the validity of modus ponens. The validity is not in question; the issue is that it's not very *useful*, since nobody questions that M.P. is valid, and any discussion would obviously thus center around the acceptability of the premises.  Leaving that aside, and moving on to the actual discussion:  &gt; Aside from that though, the positive law principle is nonsensical because it invokes natural law to begin with. If you claim that the law is good because it avoids conflict and offence, you are still claiming (without justification) that avoiding conflict and offence is good.  &gt; The justification is still a moral one.  Technically speaking, we could simply understand law in a functional sense, without necessarily passing judgement on the associated function; this would see law as primarily methodological. It's probably fair, though, to say that most would agree that the morality of a law is at least relevant to our judgement of a law; the question is the degree of that relevance, as well as the nature of that relationship.  I may be remembering the precise details wrong (or learnt it wrongly in the first place), but as I understand it, the difference isn't so much whether morality is relevant to law, but how relevant it is, in that a positivist can admit that morality can be used to judge law but cannot be used to disqualify something from being a law, whereas natural law theorists often take the position that you state: that immoral law doesn't even qualify as law. I would agree that all else being equal, a moral law is preferable to an immoral one, but it does appear to me that going on to claim that such a law isn't even a law (as you claimed: 'no law at all') effectively ignores law as a category of values, since that would just reduce law to an offshoot of morality.  Put another way: I don't agree that a positivist view of law is ultimately dependent on a moral view, because I see law as a distinct class of values not reducible (even if strongly related) to morality due to its fundamentally social nature and organisational purpose. Loosely speaking, one could point to aesthetics as another example of how value systems are not all dependent on moral values, even if related and even often overlapping.  &gt; The idea that avoiding conflict in and of itself is a moral good is almost entirely indefensible. Conflict is an inevitable result of human interaction, law should manage it, not avoid it.  I agree, but does the law really avoid it entirely? It seems to me that it tends to be enforced largely on high-profile cases, leaving the more everyday disagreements untouched. That does appear to me to be an effort at managing the conflict — including clamping down on those prominent cases that are likely to create more disturbance.  That is, I'm not so sure that 'managing' versus 'avoiding' conflict would imply leaving cases like Amos Yee or Amy Cheong alone.  &gt; Unless you were born under a rock you would know that the real purpose of these laws is to avoid threats to the ruling party, not peaceful coexistence. The best way to inflame a conflict is to avoid talking about it. This will end up biting the PAP in the rear one day.  &gt; I hope the country survives it...  Examples? I'm not being deliberately disagreeable here; I honestly can't recall offhand a case involving such conflict where the party was *deliberately* prioritised over the national interest. I would agree that the PAP is probably overly *paranoid* in interpreting cases as a threat to peaceful coexistence, but I'm much more sceptical of the view that the law's *purpose* is to defend the party *rather than* the general peace.| 1| 2015-04-02 22:36:20

singapore| Apparatus404| It's not a Singapore problem. It's pretty much the same internationally. Just look at Reddit. You'll get similar reactions if you were to criticize another person's country. It's just because Singapore is really really small. So the effects are more exaggerated since 30 people can seem like a lot or something to that effect.  Actually, even the whole Lee Kuan Yew death with him suddenly being loved and people arguing about whether he should be spoken ill of or not isn't even unique to Singapore. There was an article posted in this sub earlier talking about the death of Ronald Regan. The way his was handled by America was incredibly similar to how Singapore handled LKY's death.  And Amos Yee is also a regular emo angry teenager with access to social media and a need to express. If you read his angry blog post, you can see it's not anything enlightening or special. Anyone who had at one point been an ostracized angry teenager would have had similar thoughts. I know I did. I even have some cynical angry blog posts from the past that I cringe at now.  Basically, we aren't special. It's not about Singaporeans. Humanity reacts this way. If you're baffled by the replies, you're being baffled by human beings being angry online. And we humans can be pretty dumb, especially online.  Also, angry people are the ones who are probably more willing to waste time and effort into posting ranty things at an anonymous person online. People who aren't affected by the criticism would ignore it and go on with life. Which means there's going to be a lot more obvious angry people represented online than those that don't give a shit.| 4| 2015-04-02 06:39:44
singapore| emansih| My take on Amos Yee incident? Like I said,in the first sentence.  &gt;I am not here to discuss about Amos Yee actions  But, if you want to hear it. Here is my opinion.   I think that there is a double standards when Amos Yee was charged for insulting Christianity. Remember [Jason Neo](http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Singapore/Story/A1Story20111118-311261.html)? Insulting the muslim, calling them terrorist, is not ok. But, have you heard any news of him getting charged? Have you heard of any news of him even appearing in court? In fact, no news at all. Whereas with Amos Yee case, you see the headlines big on the front page of the newspaper. **Is it because**, Jason is affiliated with certain party, which gives him immunity from prosecution?  With regards to him insulting Lee Kuan Yew, if he had cold hard facts, he maybe able to get off scot free. But there were some "sources"(Roy Ngerg) he gave that makes it uncredible.   Like what he said in the video, "Why is it that people get sued when they start questioning the government"?  | 11| 2015-04-01 22:29:29
malaysia| CorollaSE| He is articulate, eloquent and well versed in the language. He did his research, even though he used data up to 2013, and he mainly compared Singapore versus European and American nations. There was only one graph that pit Singapore vs South East Asia.   His comments about LKY are hard and true. Unfortunately,his comments were made on the basis that Singapore was already developed, stable and prosperous when it certainly was not. To be fair, if LKY had not been authoritarian and downright dictatorial, Singapore would NOT have the freedom and economy that it has today. The statement that Singaporeans are not making ends meet, I find that statement a virtue of the society's unwillingness to do jobs that they assign to foreigners.   Lastly, Amos Yee showed immaturity, tactlessness, and inexperience in his deliveries. Most of his videos attempt to show that he is pandai and bijak, but this is his unbecoming. At 16, he should be refining his speech, articulating his delivery, and be charming his audience with wit, truth, and grace. Now, he will be knows as the person who hate-speeched LKY when LKY died. What a way to start his adulthood.  I actually think that he has the caliber and ability to be a great orator. He is captivating, entertaining, and funny. If he makes the effort to be graceful, to have manners, and remove his biadapness, he will be a very likable and respected person.| 9| 2015-04-01 14:40:44

singapore| dibidi| The way I see it, the context of the notion of freedom of speech has changed drastically in the last few decades or so. Whereas before the information age, access to a large audience was almost impossible for any random person to have and the power dynamic was weighted in favor of the government (not just punitive, but the centralised media means control of media), these days the situation is almost the complete opposite -- the government still has *some* power (in most cases, only punitive), but the people now have more control of the broadcast medium and can readily use it to their advantage.  Notwithstanding the change in dynamic, the principles of freedom of speech still remain -- a) you should be free to say whatever you want provided it does not infringe on another person's rights (**not** feelings, mind you), and b) you should take responsibility for your own speech, and the consequences it entails, and c) speech should only be countered with more speech, unless a) is affected.  That being the case where are we now in terms of freedom of speech? We are at a point where as much as a) is still correct, it's very easy these days to get away with not dealing with b) and to not follow c).  We see it everyday whenever someone gets 'STOMP-ed', when seemingly harmless but rude actions done by people in public get blown up to insane proportions by a public hungry for more and "citizen-journalists" out for blood, and in cases like SMRT-Feedback, or TRS, whereby people are doxxed, harassed and get punishments that far outweigh the original offense.  In this case, yes, Amos Yee is a dickbag and he needs to be taught a lesson (personally I blame the parents more and I shook my head when the mother announced publicly that she gives up on her son. *No mother should ever give up on their son*), but imagine what would have happened had he not been arrested and charged? It's not unthinkable that internet vigilantes will take it upon themselves to teach this kid a lesson themselves, and blow it out of proportion.  What I'm saying is, what would be a better paradigm? A government that takes action against speech that offends, albeit in a way that is more akin to a slap on the wrist than being 'disappeared', or A government that does nothing against speech that offends and can be largely impotent against random people taking it upon themselves to seek retribution (cyber-bullying, doxxing, hacking, etc) for themselves?  I'm not sure myself, but right now I'm leaning towards the former, especially if the possible victim might be child.  What is expressly wrong, however, is mass media's (Straits Times, Mediacorp, etc) treatment of the issue and making him even more of an infamous celebrity. That is exactly what he wanted in the first place, and I can't believe they're stupid enough not to realize that.| 2| 2015-04-01 10:22:38

singapore| _theia| There will never be someone completely satisfied with any government. However, I quite enjoy being Singaporean. I know that it was not Lee Kuan Yew alone who built this nation, but he was the man who held it together. He came across as the strict father trying to produce quality children, and for the most part, I think he did. Or I'd like to think so.   Amos Yee is entitled to his opinion. He's a 17-year old who (I dunno) probably thinks being a prick is cool. Maybe he just enjoys it. He seems like if he put this teen angst away and focused on the points he tried to make with proper evidence and research, he would be seen completely differently.   Amos also has a stigma attached to it because of some older videos he did when he was younger. A lot of people already didn't like him.   Here comes the point on free speech and government criticism - and this is just my opinion. Criticize the government all you want. Hate the government. Vote against them in the next election. But when you're presenting your views on a platform that reaches a wide audience,  be careful with your words and facts. You won't see blatant ads set out to disgrace political opponents here, and contrary to popular belief, ministers HAVE been sued by opposition party leaders for defamation. An opposition party contested at the last election, and won in a big constituency. Despite political differences, they argued respectfully and did not resort to incorrect facts and slander.  That is the kind of speech I want to hear in Singapore.| 6| 2015-04-01 08:39:51
singapore| FinnSolomon| Hi Joey, just let me give you a bit of background that may explain why the authorities took action.  Amos Yee was not charged because he insulted our government, or that he insulted Lee Kuan Yew. He was charged with three offences. The first two were related to comments he made about Christianity, comparing LKY to Jesus and saying that both are charlatans. The third relates to an obscene photo he photoshopped and posted of LKY having anal sex with Margaret Thatcher. Let's discuss his main offence first, his comments about religion.  Singapore is tiny compared to the US, and even to some US cities. One video reaches further here than it does over there. Like the US, Singapore has a history of racial riots, although ours had a religious element too. [The 1964 race riots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_race_riots_in_Singapore) [The 1969 race riots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_race_riots_of_Singapore)  Remember the Rodney King riots in LA? Or the Ferguson riots in St Louis? They had devastating effects on both cities. The US as a whole could recover from the damage, because your country is huge. But imagine if that happened in Singapore. The consequences would be catastrophic for us if something similar happened here. Our culture is to err on the side of caution with regards to sensitive topics that could lead to extreme backlash, because if it happens to us just once, our reputation and indirectly our economic strengths would vanish overnight.  Singapore has a large community of Muslims, and the authorities have previously arrested and charged bloggers for making offensive comments about race and religion. [Blogger faces sedition charges](http://singaporerebel.blogspot.sg/2005/09/17-year-old-to-face-sedition-charges.html)  So you see, Amos made his video at the worst possible time. It was at the height of national mourning, and emotions were raw. His video therefore went viral, and a lot of Christians took notice of the offensive comments he made. The authorities *cannot* do nothing, because that would leave our Christian community making comparisons to previous cases where bloggers were arrested for insulting Muslims. We cannot afford to give the impression that one religious group has special treatment over another. So at the very least, Amos had to be arrested and his case had to be investigated.  Now in a perfect world, people would understand that Amos is your typical awkward teenager with poor social skills, and his video was just a deliberate attempt at gaining notoriety by pissing people off. In a perfect world, people could separate their grief at LKY's death and look at Amos's video objectively. But as LKY was fond of saying, Singapore deals with the world as it is, not how we'd like it to be. Given the 'perfect storm' of factors, he had to be arrested.  Also, it's important to note he hasn't actually been sentenced yet. Three years is the maximum sentence, which hasn't been meted out yet even for other cases. I expect him to receive some form of counselling, which given his parents' declaration that they cannot communicate with him at all, seems like the best thing that could be done for him.| 18| 2015-04-01 07:47:41
singapore| kanev91| that what is wrong with singapore - you live like shit but think that others also live like shit. That's why Amos Yee did what he did - he lived in US and knows what a life can be if you love what you do| 0| 2015-04-01 07:37:48
singapore| vbevan| Freedom of speech, in the American sense, means you can say what you want without fear of government or legal reprisal (with narrow exceptions). You still have social repercussions. But here, it's the government doing the punishment.  If you only allow freedom of speech for things which don't offend, what's the point? If something offends you, I'm still waiting for why I should care. You're being offended doesn't make what I, or in this case Amos Yee, any less true. Don't like it? Then fight back with more speech.| 17| 2015-04-01 07:17:49
singapore| tomfalling| I believe one freak show out of 5 million Singaporeans is a statistic I can get behind.   TBH throughout last week I was anticipating all the things that could go wrong and how it would impact how our history would have been written. Maybe a anti PAP/LKY protest riot, or some crazy person in the queue, or some complaints about foreigners visiting the parliament and 'petitioning' (latest trend, everything also petition change.org) to stop non pink IC people from visiting, because 'Singaporeans-First', or some fuck up with the SAF drills and procedures, or some minister say some really dumb shit, and so many other things that could have gone wrong in the 7 days. But the only high negative impact case was this 17 year old. (Don't count bread talk, and Teo Ser Luck's workout)  *this post will probably get down voted to oblivion due to unpopular opinion. And also because I came late. But I just want to rant*  But back to Amos Yee, I feel he is wrong in trying to incite hate in the society, and that he needs to be taught what it means to live in our society. Where we live among different races, religions and language, where there is tolerance and respect for other humans.  I would too have called the cops on him. If his parents can't control him, how would you think you can get him to counselling? By inviting him? Commenting on his YouTube channel:  "Hi Amos, thank you for expressing your views on LKY and other matters in Singapore. We have heard what you have said, and I think you could have said it in a more tact manner, maybe not calling names and spewing accusations. Perhaps you should consider going for a course in 好公民 or 50 ways to speak to people. That should improve your acceptability to your target audience of Singaporeans."  No I say. Because besides the authority of parents, its the law that should take care of our people. The law in itself is a reformative system, not a death sentence. So by calling the cops on him and sending him into the direction of the law, I feel is just.  Then there is our duty as a citizen should stop, because then the system should take over, deciding his charge and sentence thereafter. Therefore no one should be asking for him to be jailed, caned, counselled or set free. It should be up to the system that has worked so far, we have agreed mostly upon, and kept us safe.  If am a overly sensitive and immature person, why can't I just be 'gracious' and 'bigger than him', and just let him go?  Because he still has his own followers and other idiots like him may be inspired to join him and his crusade. That's how the dumb get dumber.   Somebody's got to do the teaching.  I leave you guys here with a thought, imagine one day you are at a supermarket, you observe there is a family of 2 parents and a kid of 8 years old. This kid was running around, shouting, pulling other people's trolleys, climbing shelves, finding other kids to play with him.   What would you do if you were the parent?| 1| 2015-04-01 06:29:11
singapore| qense| To add a European view to this debate: It is quite insulting towards Lee Kuan Yew that his legacy needs to be protected against the utterances of a lonely teenager in a YouTube video. If you are a political leader, you must be prepared to be criticised. You should want to be criticised. If these arguments of Amos Yee are enough to kill your reputation, you have been a very bad leader indeed. If not, the people going after Yee seem rather petty.  I read an analysis of LKY's influence, saying that his Chinese and Russian groupies have gotten one thing wrong: LKY's Singaporean system is not about authoritarianism only. LKY of course wanted his PAP to remain in power, but used something the groupies don't want. The use of democracy to keep the ruling elite awake and in check is essential. Otherwise, you get corruption, self-centredness and alienation from the general public as the system ossifies. (Dutch Republic is a great comparison to the Singaporean Republic, but the Dutch Republic became an oligarchy after 50-100 years.)  For LKY's system to work, you need not to dampen all criticism. His successors seem to have taken a tougher line, thereby endangering LKY's project.  Also, people have been saying this is so sad for LHL. However, yes, it may be sad for him in his role as a son. But he has a more important role, that of head of government. In that function personal feelings should not play a role in his judgement. It does hurt if your recently deceased father is criticised, but as a PM you should be above that.  As for the sensitivity towards religions: as someone with anti-religious convictions I believe that you should be free to criticise religion. If you identify so much with certain ideas that a debate about them hurts you, you need to reconsider your maturity. If you become violent and unreasonable when your religion is criticised or mocked, you lack civilisation.  (And yes, I do believe that Dieudonné should not have been arrested, and also that making Holocaust denial illegal is an insult to the magnitude of that horror. But by pointing to the shortcoming in other countries, you don't absolve yourself of your own.)| 2| 2015-04-01 06:16:43
singapore| daveonhols| No, I agree.  I see lots of whataboutism - "but what about France, what about Germany, what about the US", but little in depth thought about the topic from first principles.    What would happen if people like Amos Yee had the freedom to say things like what Amos Yee said?  Would there be riots and chaos?  Well, he did say that, and there wasn't any riots.  How fragile do people thing Singapore is?  Wouldn't it be better to use draconian laws to prevent riots rather than prevent things that might (but probably won't) cause riots?  Evidently you can't stop people from saying offensive things anyway, even with it being criminal.  Also, if you want to have a mature debate on freedom of speech, you need to tease out all the different types of restrictions on different types of speech and address them seperately.  Amos was charged with offending religion, posting obscene pictures and under the new charge of harassment.  All of these are very different things...  Unfortunately, as long as the mind set of the ruling party in Singapore remains as it is, it will be hard to have a meaningful debate on these topics, because the real facts are often hidden or spun for political reasons.  For example, when it comes to defamation, we are often told that this is necessary to protect politicians from baseless accusations, but we often don't hear (anymore) the other side of the story - for example when this has been abused for political ends.  How many people know for example what JBJ actually said at that election rally in December 1996?  How many people know what Tang Liang Hong actually said that got him into so much trouble? Etc etc.| 2| 2015-04-01 05:32:47
singapore| condor_gyros| &gt; no one cares enough to go around making a police report, and even if they did, the police would probably do nothing unless there was a huge public outcry.  This certainly sounds like an unequal application of the law. It sends the message that if I can kpkb enough, then celebrating a person's death is not just more heinous than calling for someone to be killed just because of what they have said, but that the latter is condoned. For netizens who are calling for Amos Yee to be beaten up or killed, it would thus be consistent for them to also approve of the Charlie Hebdo massacre.| 2| 2015-04-01 04:21:48
singapore| PONGEST_LENIS| People have varying opinions on Lee Kuan Yew, but nonetheless respect him for bringing Singapore to what it is. Many political leaders who clashed swords with Lee during his reign still attended the wake to pay their last respects. Furthermore, the past week the country has been mourning his passing, so emotions were on a high. Amos Yee then decided that it would be a good time to share to the world his opinions of Lee Kuan Yew in the most insensitive way possible.   I have no problem with his criticism of the government, but I do have a problem when he insults religion and rejoices the death of someone who is the reason why he is able to live comfortably today, and wishes that he does not rest in peace. He is entitled to freedom of speech. But he is not entitled to being a fucking prick.   TL;DR: freedom of speech =/= being an asshole. | 21| 2015-04-01 03:48:16
singapore| purebluejp| There are definitely underlying truths in the points brought up by Amos Yee. But it is really obvious what the true intent of the video was. It was to spite Singaporeans during the time of LKY's death. He wanted his 5minutes of fame, and he got it. The kid has wrecked his entire future from that video. Singapore is such a small country, the moment you get famous for the wrong reason, you're pretty much screwed.| 12| 2015-04-01 03:41:31
videos| Zodurus| Singaporean here, just to clarify that: -  Amos Yee was arrested and is currently being charged under the Sedition Act for giving negative remarks against Christianity. His is currently out on bail.  Regarding the freedom of speech (and a little bit of history): Yes, we may be ranked one of the lowest among other first-world countries but even so, as Singapore is a multi-racial and -religious society, touching on a topic related to either of the aforementioned subjects is a sensitive matter and may lead to unrest among different groups of citizens.  Look at our situation before such laws were passed in parliament. Irresponsible media reporting on related-issues (e.g. Maria Hertogh riots) which fueled racial tensions and led to the eruption of racial riots over the nation.  Such laws (like the Sedition Act) had to be implemented to ensure the peace of our society to move the country forward as a whole, and to prevent history from repeating itself.  For further reading on the Sedition Act, check out http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=DocId%3A%221f6d9e4b-1cf1-4575-9480-da4bdeff9ef4%22%20Status%3Apublished%20Depth%3A0;rec=0| 1| 2015-04-01 03:04:32
singapore| syanda| Probably the same reason why places like TRS comments are completely able to get away with spewing hateful crap: no one cares enough to go around making a police report, and even if they did, the police would probably do nothing unless there was a huge public outcry.  Amos Yee riled the public enough due to his comments on LKY, but stuff like telling all immigrants to leave Singapore (in less polite terms) are allowed to fly.| 3| 2015-04-01 02:44:37
singapore| OJ_Rifkin| Are you kidding? This is absolutely about free speech, nothing else. Amos Yee made the video, but it was just a set up. It was the Singaporean government who hammered the point down. And the point is that LKY's Singapore is severely lacking in free speech.| 2| 2015-04-01 02:38:34
singapore| bat-affleck|   &gt;&gt;What an assumption, you literally took two case out in two first world country, then you made an assumption for the majority of first world countries.  It's you that make an assumption, I said we are not alone.. Means there's *at least* 1 more country not applying free speech.. I never say Majority... But then I gave 2 (france &amp; germany)... Extra bonus.  also, germany is not the only country that criminalize Holocaust denials.. There's 17+ countries &amp; Even EU tried to pass a law about it. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial  &gt;&gt;Let's take a more rigid source, shall we? Here, [Strait Times](http://www.straitstimes.com/news/world/more-world-stories/story/lastest-world-press-freedom-index-shows-drastic-decline-singapor), 2015. They reported a story about World Press Freedom Index. Singapore is ranked 153 on the rank (and it is a consistent decline from the year before). The next first world country is Italy, rank 73. And no, unlike your assumptions, most of the first world countries is ranked at the top. The top 8 is all first world countries. Some might surprise you, like how USA is ranked below Burkina Faso, but the point still stand: first world countries are generally in the top half of the ranking in freedom of press.  &gt;&gt;In fact, out of 180 countries, Singapore is the only first world country in the bottom half (assuming that the 'half' is 90th) and Singapore is WAY LOW on the bottom half.  sorry, this is different. Freedom of  press is part of freedom of speech, but not vice versa. What I am talking here is, to be more specific: freedom of *hate* speech. How even in france &amp; germany there are regulations for these..   but I do agree that SG needs more printed publication from opposing views..but that is a separate discussion   &gt;&gt;Yes, that is true. You can make extreme people angry if you make cartoons like Charlie Hebdo. But that doesn't mean making cartoon like Charlie Hebdo is wrong. This is why millions of people marches through Paris: They SUPPORT the idea of Charlie Hebdo, they SUPPORT the idea of free speech. Your example is a bad one.  They marched for the dead.  and if they do march for free speech, i call those people are hypocrites. How come they do not march for holocaust denials? How come they don't march for the comedian that got arrested 2 days after the march? Arrested for 4-words facebook status! Free speech my ass. It's free as long it doesn't insult me. Hypocrite freedom.  And for me (a christian), charlie hebdo cartoons are wrong. They are bullying islam minorities,  ridicule &amp; dehumanizing Moslems. Making fun of people's faith is wrong. And they did it repeatedly. Can you imagine grow up as a moslem kid in that environment? no wonder Paris suffered 2 tiots for the past 6 years.   Of course it shouldn't get the cartoonist killed. But those cartoons are wrong.   &gt;&gt;And how many people die on the streets exactly? You make it seems like there's a massacre. You picks a couple of examples and generalise the whole thing. Of course there are going to be extremes, but ask people in USA and France or any first world country if they want more freedom of press in criticising the government, I bet they would gladly accept it.  you assume I make it sound like massacre. and how many ppl need to die before we get the lesson?   Oh, and please lah: im talking about hate speech to a person/ religion/race. Don't get mixed up with press freedom in criticizing government.   You can critic without spewing hate.   And since this discussion sparked by amos yee's video... None in his video is a valid criticism. Most are hate speech... With some porn reference.   &gt;&gt;This is just pure bias. I can also say that Singapore is just preventing any bad words for LKY. But both of us have no proof on that.  I read this long ago. It's a policy as a result of multiple riots (5? 7?) In '64 &amp; '69. But yeah.. Who knows..  &gt;&gt; The point I'm trying to assert is that free speech is a basic human right, and it is not to be taken away.  Is Hate speech  a  basic right? Ridiculing &amp; bullying other's faith (esp. minorities) a basic right?  &gt;&gt; If the Singaporean government is jailing a 17 years old kid for 3 years because they can't take criticism that has a little bit of swearing in it, then I agree with Amos Yee: they're fucking dicks.  Ah, for this, actually I prefer him to get counseling. But he did speak hateful remarks and not a single criticism. (Critic is where you highlight some error and preferably offer solution.. Not saying LKY sucking some d*cks). And 17y.o. kids is old enough to accept the consequences of his doing. he is not a baby.   &gt;&gt;Everywhere there will be race riots. Indonesia is a big country with a lot of races, and there's a lot of races, yet nobody complains a lot about them.  Uhh... Jakarta 1998 riot where thousands of Chinese were killed, looted &amp; raped. Also Surakarta 1998. Poso riot where dozen of villages burned. Ambon islam vs Christian riot in 2000 that lasted for a year. Madura vs dayak where they killed each other for generations.these are only 1998 till now. Want more?   &gt;&gt;&gt; USA is another example, they embrace their difference in race and religion.  Yeah... You dont read about ferguson riot early this year?  How about this, the major LA riot that last for days/week http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots   &gt;Shutting every people up and to make everyone obey to the whole Singaporean government's narrative is DEFINITELY not the way to go in reducing race divide problems. In history, we can see how this system fails: USSR, North Korea and China is even now heavily criticised and is generally hated for their system.   Now now... You are exaggerating.. In Singapore, you CAN freely criticized the gov and challenge their policies. There are plenty of websites doing it already. Just do it in civilized manner, no hate, no defamation.    Ussr, china, N.korea? I mean,  really bro?  Writere for websites like therealsingaporean.sg will be hanged in those countries.  &gt;&gt;If Singapore is really still scared that race divide is still a problem, then the key, in my unexpert, most humble opinion, is education. Instead of shutting people up, the Singaporean government should raise the education system, like how a civilised government would do. However, I don't think race divide is still a problem. Although I do not have any legitimate source on it, but at least, in my part of Singapore, the youth of Malays, of Indians, of Muslims, of Buddhist, of Chinese, of Foreigner; they all live and mingle with each other just fine.   Again, no one shutting people up... Unless you speak hate. (Same thing in germany: free speech for all, just not about holocaust/jews)  Also, We just had little india riot last year! How can you say race divide is not a problem?   (It is a small &amp; quick riot, yes.. But riot nevertheless. )  about education.. may help, yes. but Education cant make you ignore the fact that your religion is being ridiculed in a magazine every month. Education doesn't make hurtful youtube video about your religion go away. Education can't remove anger in your heart hearing people making fun of your skin color.  i have to say, you live in ideal world. i live in real fragile world. I was there in jakarta 1998. racial tense shit is real. if what happened in jakarta happened here. that's it for singapore.   if you think Singapore security / safety is a given.. think again. there's a latent constant effort to make it happen. controlling hate speech is one  of them  EDIT:massive editing. | 5| 2015-04-01 01:55:33
singapore| TheBoyWhoHatesYou| Didn't another lady who made some discriminating comment about a malay family having a wedding at her house void deck and got prosecuted as well? If the government prosecuted one who made racist comments, they will have to do the same for Amos Yee, but content-wise, Amos Yee didn't really made much sense to me, once he said Jesus was power-hungry, I couldn't really take him seriously anymore, Other than bringing up a few statistical facts | 1| 2015-04-01 00:45:28

(See 1964 -1969 race riots) Does he still relevant now? Is singapore still as fragile as 1969? I say yes lets not find out....  Everywhere there will be race riots.

SubredditDrama| KaliYugaz| You can't assume that what works in Singapore will work or even make sense in America. We have a huge country that allows us to self-segregate and strong social norms that generally discourage communal tensions, except in rural and urban backwaters that nobody cares about. Our politics is so complicated, vast in scope, and diverse that extremist movements will find it very difficult to establish the requisite organization and popular appeal take over the entire country. If a race riot happens in one American city, they can change how they do things and move on, and the rest of the country is unaffected. If a race riot happens in Singapore, the country is destroyed.  And Amos Yee was not arrested for blaspheming against LKY, he was arrested for agitation against a religious group.| 0| 2015-03-31 23:55:38
SubredditDrama| KaliYugaz| Yes. The only reason Reddit loves Amos Yee is because he is exactly the kind of delusional, narcissistic, sexist, selfish, uneducated, and poorly brought up neckbeard tool that they are. | -2| 2015-03-31 23:37:38
videos| Bicko| Such a thinking works both ways: From the point of view of radical theists, that would claim that people who espouse human reasoning and rationality as the one de facto way to understanding and interpreting the world are ignorant and deluded as well. And conversely, many atheists would share your sentiments about how religion confounds rationality, which is the proper way of interpreting reality.  You have the **complete** right to hold these views that you mentioned, but problem is that if you express yourself in the these very exact words, you're bound to rile up disagreements and conflict. And isn't that precisely what the anti-sedition law in Singapore intends to avert?   You're allowed to disrespect a person's beliefs if you believe them to be false, but you should not be allowed to disrespect the person. Something which I think Amos Yee fails to do.| 0| 2015-03-31 23:12:36
singapore| AlexTeddy888| I want to address these points:  &gt;a cult of personality has been developed around LKY  That's true, but it's certainly not because of propaganda or the government pushing a positive image of him, but rather his style of leadership and the results he has achieved with it. Singapore is considered to be a success story and LKY, a pragmatic statesman who has conviction. Add the two together and LKY gets a lot of credit for making things better. He's the public face of the government - we barely know anyone else in it - so naturally he would be idolised in the way that he is now.  For the other two points, they are completely true, but the problem is the way in which he presented these arguments, and that is through a lot of emotion and opinion rather than facts and analysis. His negative tone towards not only LKY, but of Singaporeans and how they are brainwashed, would detract from any meaningful discussion that we could pursue. We should talk about these issues in a reasoned and developed manner, not at the height of emotions as Amos Yee has done.| 1| 2015-03-31 23:12:22
singapore| mispronounced| I believe that if individuals call the police, they will also have to prove that their actions are warranted. Not many people have so much time as to bring frivolous law suits or file frivolous police reports; I believe that the law provides for that as well.  Thank you for your post. I absolutely agree with what you've said. Reading the comments by what I can only assume are mostly Western-born and raised redditors on the Amos Yee case was infuriating because so many of them were judging the case from their own Western/American centred perspectives, oblivious to the imperfections of their so called "free" and truly democratic country.| 3| 2015-03-31 23:09:37
singapore| mispronounced| As others have pointed out, freedom of speech does not exclude one from responsibility for what one says. IMO, the law exists to provide a guideline for responsible, civil behaviour. If one is irresponsible with one's actions and breaks a law, it is the duty of the law to mete out a suitable punishment. Amos Yee was irresponsible with his words and actions, just like anyone who makes uninformed comments on the internet. Moreover, he crossed a line that Singaporean society deemed important to maintain, and therefore police reports were made against him. Saying that this is a sad reality of our society is like saying it is a sad reality that people can get offended at things someone else said. It is a reality, but is it necessarily sad if it is a part of the human condition, and not unique to Singaporean society?  As u/bat-affleck also pointed out, Western society is often seen as a paragon for free speech, but there are countless cases of Westerners being irresponsible with their right to free speech. Why should this be any different just because our society is not deemed as a true democracy, especially if other "true democracies" are not perfect and beyond reproach either?  The only sad reality I see here is that of Amos Yee's life - a 17 year old kid who thought he knew better. I hope he learns a lesson about being responsible for what he says. I'm not saying that everything he said was wrong, but he didn't say anything necessary that has not already been said by others.| 1| 2015-03-31 23:03:17
singapore| AlexTeddy888| This sort of video wouldn't have been blown up if it weren't for it's timing, which is around Lee Kuan Yew's death. Emotions are high, so naturally people would react quite negatively to such a damning critique of LKY and of Singaporeans in general. It even lambasts how Singaporeans are practically brainwashed into supporting and obeying the government, which would piss off a lot of people. This sort of furore after a recent event has occurred in many places, most notably after 9/11 in America and the start of the Iraq War.  I do agree that we shouldn't give him the attention that he wants. Many of his points are contradictory and narrow-minded and by responding to him, we only justify what he is saying. He does make some good points but these are overshadowed by the overall negativity of his video. But again, people won't really look at each individual detail, but rather at the video as a whole and what it intended to achieve: criticise LKY. Coupled with how Amos Yee believed Singaporeans are "sheeple" deceived by the government, people want to defend themselves. It's no surprise.  The government's charge of Amos Yee may justify his points of how the government restricts freedom of speech and freedom of expression, but there are some very solid reasons for the charges filed against him. The video contained a damning indictment of Christianity being a dictator-like religion, which opposes the government's policy of preventing offensive racial or religious remarks. It could also be used as defaming LKY and his son, and thus considered as libel. It's a very thin line between defaming politicians and simply criticising the government.  The best reaction to this is to simply not join in the debate, or at least make an objective stand rather than relying on raw emotion, as both sides have done. Stay out of it as best as one could, but I find it alright to participate in these sort of threads when we're looking down at what he is doing without going too deep.| 1| 2015-03-31 22:58:38
videos| By_Design_| &gt; In the end, everyone should be free to disagree with each other's beliefs  but Amos Yee clearly isn't free to disagree with religion. Calling religion a blind faith is about as tame of an accusation as you can make. He should be allowed to insult religious views all day if he wishes without fear of arrest.| 2| 2015-03-31 22:23:04

In his video, he hoped that **LKY would not rest in peace**, and in another writing, **wrote about his mum jumping out of the window**. He also tweeted out that he is **"officially making fun of suicidal people"**. I'm discussing about Amos Yee, not LKY, I don't really mind that you criticise him, but I would appreciate it if you would keep the discussion in the right direction.  Are you sure that you have taken a look at his writings?| 2| 2015-03-31 21:53:40
singapore| atomic_rabbit| I agree that the more ignorant criticisms can be annoying, but in my opinion it's always worth bearing in mind that they ultimately have a point. The balance between free speech and social order is *very* heavily tilted towards the latter in Singapore, and this *is* a real problem that Singaporeans ought to grapple with. Not just specifically in this Amos Yee case, which is a clusterfuck any side you look at it from, but in many other worthier cases (the MDA power grab over local blogs comes to mind). The fact that the liberal democracies have tons of their own problems doesn't negate this.| 2| 2015-03-31 21:52:45
singapore| FayBooLess| Unrelated to topic, but reading the responses here really warmed my heart. :') A very welcomed distraction from the Amos Yee brouhaha.  OP, all the best! Stay strong. I'm glad everything worked out for you!| 20| 2015-03-31 21:23:58
singapore| SunnyFunnyBunny| This would probably be buried but..  I do believe that caveat for freedom of speech in Singapore would be to (a) Not say anything defamatory and (b) not hold the "deliberate intention of wounding the religious or racial feelings of any person". In this case, Amos Yee's speech falls largely in the latter category. Now this law was put into place back in the days when we had racial riots so as to preserve the harmony between all races and religion. By broadcasting a video that "wound the religious" feelings of Christians in a country that prides itself in preserving racial and religious harmony, it poses as a threat to that fine balance which we held on to since 1969. Your argument that this arrest shows how insecure, immature and sensitive we are is true to some extent but i do believe that the arrest was to prevent something like this from happening again. By not arresting Amos Yee based on those remarks (no matter how attention-seeking they are), we are setting a precedence that hate speech against religion and race is acceptable. Yes, you might say they were much milder than the hate speeches from the Neo-Nazis and the KKK, but here's the thing, all these hateful comments, it all has to begin somewhere. You can spew whatever speech you want, but the moment that whatever you are spewing threatens the fabric of our nation, the government will step in. So I don't believe the arrest illustrates our immaturity and insecurity, rather we are just nipping a potential problem in the bud.  I believe your other argument is that Singaporeans reacted emotionally and blew the issue up instead of reacting rationally  and that this displays our insecurity, immaturity and sensitivity. As much as it was clear this attention seeking video was all part of Amos Yee's plan, it is a little hard to ask Singaporeans not to be upset over it. Our great leader has just passed on, the person responsible for assembling a team of capable ministers (Goh Keng Swee, Toh Chin Chye, S Rajaratnam etc.) to bring our country to where it is today; a visionary respected and admired all over the world. Though he is no saint, many Singaporeans hold an emotional attachment to him and regard him as our 'father'. Naturally, if someone insulted your father, as rational as you may be, you will be upset. Because LKY held such an important place in many peoples lives and hearts, a video such as this would definitely provoke a reaction. Hence I do not think it's very fair to say that because of this big reaction we are insecure immature and sensitive, rather I would say Amos knew the right buttons to push to get the attention he wants.  I do find it hard though to show that Singapore as a society is secure and mature because these terms are a little bit subjective. I have many several friends who are Anti-PAP and use facebook as a platform to air their views. However on the day LKY passed on, all these friends were respectful and knew that this is not the appropriate time for Anti-PAP statuses and pictures and they took time to acknowledge some of his contributions to Singapore. That to me personally shows that Singaporeans in general are mature to know that everything has it's time and place and are objective in their opinions. Perhaps the reality of our society is not that sad after all  tl;dr : we don't want a bigger problem in the future so we arrest that boy; his comments on LKY is akin to calling our father a dog; hopefully I change your view | 4| 2015-03-31 21:15:40
singapore| spvn| I'm gonna piggyback this top comment to post a comment I've been making over and over again since this fiasco first started:  Freedom to speech has NEVER meant "you can say whatever the hell you want". This exceedingly common misconception is really frustrating. You're only allowed to voice opinions that do not infringe on the reputations and rights of others.  From the UDHR  &gt; 3) The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary: &gt;  &gt; (a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others; &gt;  &gt; (b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals.  There have always been limitations on the freedom to speech, because if everyone was allowed to say anything they wanted, we'd have a lot of bigger societal problems on our hands. In the case of Amos Yee, he insulted both the late PM (who's obviously a major political figure and sort of a symbol for the nation as a whole) as well as an entire religion (which is a very very sensitive topic for many people and should not be taken lightly).| 29| 2015-03-31 21:08:03
worldnews| redditexspurt| Don't you think he's probably just rubbing the same grain you rubbed the wrong way when you were that age? Maybe you just didn't have the guts.   "given bail set at S$20,000 (£9,800; $14,500)."  Wow, that doesn't seem excessive at all. Don't you think the attitude you are expressing may be the same attitude that enables these kind of abuses to occur?  "Speaking outside the courtroom, his father apologised to the current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is Mr Lee's son."  LOL ok I see how it works there.   "Amos Yee was one of several people who went online to publicly criticise Mr Lee's legacy - others include human rights activists and a prominent poet - but he is the only one to have been arrested." | 1| 2015-03-31 20:19:29
singapore| syanda| While I think Amos Yee is a complete ass and pretty neckbeardy, I was rather appalled by the vocal section of society calling for him to be caned, jailed, prosecuted beyond the extent of the law, or hell, even some calling him to be beaten up or killed. I honestly hope that it was just some vocal minority, but it does make me lose a lot of hope.| 11| 2015-03-31 19:56:28
singapore| dtwn| Nope. Porn. I.e. Obscene material that Amos Yee is being accused of spreading.  It's not that odd really. Legalising it allows the government to maintain checks on it while ensuring a relative level of health and hygiene for sex workers and their johns. An outright ban would not work.

singapore| jinhong91| Better be safe than to be really sorry. Sorry as in there is no recovery from that, kinda like a nuclear disaster. Because Singapore, in essence, only has 1 life and so the cost of fucking it up is huge.   I also think free speech still can be used against yourself or backfire horribly. A says something that offends B because free speech. B retorts which makes A have a hissy fit because free speech. A shoots back at B. B shoots back at A. Never-ending, it's a vicious cycle. And then there are those riots in the 50-60s.   Personally, never really cared about that Amos Yee spectacle.| 3| 2015-03-31 19:17:49
singapore| zxzxlch| I'm with you /u/sebrehero2 though I think we're in the minority here. The whole Amos Yee thing says more about us Singaporeans than it does about him. 10 police reports lodged against him and people are happy because charging him with a criminal offense will teach him a lesson?  You can tell he's really an angry kid who doesn't know how to manage his emotions. The fully grown people who got their knickers in a bunch have no excuse. It's like it's their first day on the Internet and their first stop is a YouTube video comment section.  We need to grow thicker skin and be very candid and open about sensitive subjects. It's the only way we can have constructive conversations about race, religion and politics. Silencing dissident opinions hinders that. More thoughts but I've already written a post [here](https://medium.com/p/in-defense-of-amos-yee-7a5270bbef9b) if you're interested.| 1| 2015-03-31 19:08:22
singapore| WHOMADETHISDECISION| I had a conversation with some elders and I think his argument resonate with most of his generation currently. Our society thinks we own our success to Lee Kuan yew and we have to defend his reputation and honour. If Amos yee made this video to his classmate or some nobody, it wouldn't result in a huge hoo haa. But because it's Lee Kuan yew, das why. I don't think we made huge changes in ideology since the 1960s and I don't think it will change for at least another generation. | 0| 2015-03-31 19:08:16
worldnews| Penguin609| Singaporean here. Amos Yee represents a lose-lose case for the authorities, there's really no way they could have reacted without drawing flak. By arresting him, they reinforce the image of Singapore as a repressive regime in the eyes of the Western world (which I largely dispute, though I won't dive into it here) as well as earn the ire of liberals here. However, if they hadn't arrested him, the consequences would not have been minor either, for several reasons:  1. He openly attacked Christianity, and all offensive remarks on race and religion are a strict no-no. A Chinese manager once lost her job over insensitive remarks about the minority Malays, and bloggers have been charged over anti-Muslim remarks. The police cannot compromise on this, because the sacrosanct status of race and religion are a fundamental part of Singapore's identity.   2. Multiple police reports were made (over 20) by members of the public, and they cannot be seen as being soft (which is something that some of the older generation accuse the present government of being; Lee Kuan Yew would never have allowed the foreign worker strike and riot that occurred two years ago to happen, they reason). Remember the Koran-burning pastor in the US? He'd have been jailed in Singapore the moment he suggested such a thing.  3. Lee Kuan Yew is a revered figure, heavily respected even by the political opposition. Nearly 450,000 people filed past his coffin during the lying in state, and 1.2 million (more than 1/3rd of the entire citizen population) paid their respects at various community sites. Even the most hardcore of his supporters were stunned at the immense outpouring of grief, a spectacle in an ordinarily tranquil Singapore that hasn't been seen for half a century and likely never will be seen again. The leader of the Opposition, Low Thia Khiang (who contrary to the stereotype that all opposition figures are ruthlessly destroyed, actually led a team that unseated the popular former Foreign Minister, George Yeo) delivered a tribute in Parliament that recognised LKY as the irreplaceable founder of the modern nation while noting that his use of repressive tools made him imperfect. The longest ever serving Opposition MP, Chiam See Tong was one of the pallbearers for the state funeral and came to pay his respects during the lying in state, despite being confined to a wheelchair by a stroke he had years ago. The authorities CANNOT be seen to ignore such a blatant insult on such a sacred figure, especially since the country was still in an official state of mourning. It would destroy their credibility in the eyes of the ordinary Singaporean if they let such a monumental act of idiocy pass unpunished.   4. Amos Yee dangerously twists and even invents (yes, invents!) facts to suit his view that Lee Kuan Yew was a corrupt dictator that Singapore would be better off without. Ironically, the very fact that he lives a comfortable at least middle-class life with electronic gadgets and a shelf full of books is something he probably owes to the changes that LKY and his team of able ministers wrought. I'm only 19, and in the past ten years I've already seen unimaginable changes happening as Singapore develops; I live in a condominium where my mother lived in a kampong (rural village), my grandparents had to sell tidbits to supplement their income while I'm chasing a career in ecology. Singaporeans cannot tolerate deliberately lying to the world that the man who utterly changed their lives was a self-serving malicious corrupt dictator, when all the evidence points to the contrary. We believe strongly that "thou shalt not bear false testimony" should be enforceable by law.   5. Singaporeans have been travelling all over the Western world to study, work and holiday for decades; a number greatly disproportionate to our population ends up in Ivy League colleges and Oxbridge. The Internet means that there is no way the true state of the outside world can be hidden from us. To imply that we've all been hoodwinked is well, quite frankly an insult to us, so forgive us if we don't rush to defend his right to rant about how shitty Singapore is when we know full well that it isn't perfect, but it sure as hell is a sight better than nearly any other city in the world. I have a friend who one would classify as deeply anti-government and who would love to migrate as soon as he can (he has a place in MIT) - and he told me quite simply that Amos Yee was just asking for it. In other words, despite all our exposure to the systems of other countries, there is a deep understanding in Singapore that this is simply something you do not do; it violates the social understanding on which our nation is built. The police can't *not* arrest him.   TLDR: The police would have lost more in the form of the respect of the public if they hadn't arrested him than if they had. | 44| 2015-03-31 18:31:37
singapore| TrollingMcDerps| Religious sensitivity does exist.  Although the Christians in Singapore aren't the type to take offense so easily, if the gahmen were to let it slide, it will cause more religiously-insensitive posts because "If Amos Yee could do it, so can I." | 1| 2015-03-31 17:22:10
singapore| BarneyLovesYou| Honestly, I think it's through this case that we can see how 'ugly' someone can be. Not Amos Yee, but the people around him. Through his blog posts we can see that he wasn't a very well liked person in school. Even though he claims that he does not want to be popular, I believe deep down everyone wants to be recognised, wants attention. That's why he turned to social media sites like Youtube and Twitter and blogging to vent his frustrations and his opinions. People even gave death threats to him just because of his video because they think they are safe behind the screen.  What he needs is not jail time, but he needs counselling and more care and concern from the people around him. Just because he cannot fit into the norm does not give us a reason to ostracise him. Even more we should spend time to show him that being different is not a bad thing. Given his intellect I believe he can bring some insightful comments to his project mates and friends.   However, what's done can't be undone and every action has a consequence. Because if there isn't any punishment, more people will follow suit. Not the freedom of speech part, but the disrespect to our leader, our nation, people's parents and other people's religion and thinking that they can get away with it. Hopefully through this incident, Amos Yee will learn his mistake and not say anything he wants on the internet. Yes, we have the freedom of speech but that doesn't give us an excuse to intentionally hurt people, saying it's my rights to say whatever I want.   Singaporeans should also learn how to be more accepting of each other and to show more care and concern to those that needs it. I can't say that I'm a saint, but I'm trying my best to practice what I preach.   Just my thoughts on this. You guys may not agree with me, but I just think he shouldn't be punished, but counselled.   EDIT : I mean he should be punished for his action, but not to the extent of going to prison. | 56| 2015-03-31 17:16:43
singapore| junnies| amos yee shows that we /really/ have a problem with freedom of speech.  he's a 17 year old that said a few disagreeable things. in western countries, no one would probably pay much attention to him.   if you look at the /r/worldnews discussion (dominated by westerners) about him, the general sentiment is that he's made a few good points, some disagreeable and distasteful ones, but there's absolutely no reason to kick a fuss about it at all.  edmw, stomp and even this subreddit has plenty of comments as bad as anything Amos said. the only difference is that Amos made a video with his face on it so he made himself an easy target to concentrate the insecurities and angst some Singaporeans have.  at the end of the day, the police decided to arrest a 17 year old for making a video with some mildly disagreeable and distasteful content. you can invoke all sorts of rationalisations and excuses on why it was okay for them to do so, but it looks absolutely ridiculous from the point of mature people who have better things to pay attention to, and know not to take a 17 year old too seriously when he says some stupid things.| -2| 2015-03-31 17:09:50
singapore| R_Creation| Yeah i'm sorry for being vague. What i meant by that was not Amos Yee himself, but the people who responded with such conceit at his video and the arrest. It shows the dark side of our society and the incompetency of our society to act mature when it needs to be.  While of course this is aimed at the vocal minority, the fact remains that these vocal minority holds a substantial influence over the silent majority. These vocal people also do mirror the attitude of those who are against the video that he made. Singaporeans have the issue of being able to blow any minor controversy into a massive debate bomb as well, although that is less of an issue right now.  I'm interpreting his smile to be that of a person who has just proved his point, because I want to shed light on another perspective other than the standard 'attention seeking' side. As said by another poster it's not good to speculate unless Amos confirms it himself. I believe it to be so because of his challenge statement issued directly to LHL, and trying to understand his character by reading his blogs and watching some of his videos. | 5| 2015-03-31 16:58:49

singapore| R_Creation| Couldn't have put it better myself. My opinion is roughly the same as yours, that our society needs to mature to one that is representative of our education. We Singaporeans have not matured fast enough to keep in pace with our soaring GDP achievements and economical stability.  What I'm concerned about is not the arrest of Amos Yee himself, but the reaction of our society to his arrest. This is only proof that its our society that is rigid to change, and not merely the governing party.| 22| 2015-03-31 16:17:20
singapore| lloydolly| Maybe because our country places equal value on religious beliefs and the "tangible and valuable goods of others". Much more than a dead person (Jesus Christ), the government recognises the system of beliefs itself which many live by, that Amos was attacking.   My point wasnt as much about the arrest of Amos Yee per se but at the whole circlejerk over our judicial system and apparent lack of freedom, especially when the majority of these voices come from a certain nation. If my fellow countrymen can argue for the freedom that is far more superior and beneficial than ours, I'm all ears. But from them? What has their judicial system and entitlement to freedom resulted in? I dunno, George Zimmerman and Sandy Hook?  I cannot empathise with the oppression some in my country are facing, having only to express their bigoted/atheist/racist/homophobic/anti-establishment views on the internet, but I am willing to exchange that in a heartbeat for the knowledge that I can go to places safely without fear of being gunned down or attacked. And be assured that I can live as I am in this country.| 2| 2015-03-31 15:59:21

Secondly, I can get away with the chibais and FUs, but you can't, simply because the person with authority has the upper hand and he(I) is not obliged to listen to you. No matter how unfair you feel over this, in the real world, there will be some people who will abuse their power and authority and dismiss you unfairly and there is NOTHING you can do. If the person is fair and rational, yes, he may accept your view even if you are rude. But do not expect all bosses (authority) to be fair and rational, and hence always be tactful how you put your points across."  Yeah that's just how power dynamics are. In Singapore we learn this in school, and for males this is reinforced in NS where rank and position is the last word on most matters.   I'd also argue that most of the time in life, even tone or tact doesn't matter. Reddit is one example of this, where most of the time, dissent to personal views held by the individual will be downvoted no matter how it is delivered. Now imagine crossing someone powerful in real life who can crush you completely on a whim with a metaphorical big blue arrow if you disagree with them. There are some fights you simply cannot win.  To put it very crudely, the reality is that Amos Yee is a nobody who stepped on a lot of toes, and one very big foot. | 21| 2015-03-31 13:28:51
worldnews| atomic_rabbit| Despite the article title and 99% of the comments in this thread, I think it's the Christian-bashing, not the criticisms of Lee Kuan Yew, that got him arrested. For the Singapore establishment, respecting religion and ethnicity is an extremely sensitive issue, not to be fucked around with. It's practically part of the founding mythology of the country.  For this reason, the police would not have been able to ignore the dozens of police reports that members of the public lodged against Amos Yee.  Of course, Yee also knew this, and probably tossed in the anti-Christian comments specifically to ensure this outcome.| 31| 2015-03-31 13:14:13

Yee was charged with violating laws which prohibit "deliberate intention of wounding the religious or racial feelings" and for engaging in "threatening, abusive or insulting communication" prohibited by Singapore's Harassment Act.   &gt;Lawyer Chia Boon Teck filed one of the criminal complaints against Yee, saying "There is a limit to freedom of speech. If the line separating freedom and offence is crossed, the person will have to face the consequences."  Yee's mother filed a police report against him because she was unable to control his behavior.  Another person who filed a criminal complaint reported that they sought police intervention because based on the video, they worried that "even though he is arrested for these charges now, he may be arrested for worse things in the future."   &gt;Before the video was removed on Sunday 29 March it had been viewed 270,000 times.  Prior to his arrest Yee had recently become a [high school dropout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_dropouts) and declared an intent "to pursue (a) career as a 17-year-old boy ranting in front of a video camera."   &gt;  ---  ^Interesting: [^Death ^of ^Lee ^Kuan ^Yew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Lee_Kuan_Yew) ^| [^September ^2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2003) ^| [^Jonestown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown) ^| [^Mysteries ^of ^the ^Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysteries_of_the_Bible)   ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cpwblaq) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cpwblaq)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)| 1| 2015-03-31 11:40:37

singapore| justastatistic| I do not agree with the language of the law either and am a proponent of changing it to make it specific and leave no room for applying broad strokes with it. However, if you look at all the cases where this law has been enforced http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedition_Act_%28Singapore%29#Uses_of_the_Act, you can see the common denominator of religious / racial hate speech.   What matters to me most is the fact that this is a law that's in place currently and under its premise the Singapore legal system has the legal right to charge Amos Yee. If you have a gripe with a law be vocal against it, write about it, talk to your MP about it or vote for a party that doesn't favour it. But don't show your dissent by breaking it.    The rest of your points about COE, HDB, BTO are irrelevant. I never once said that criticizing the government is to be condemned. Hell, I do plenty too. | 3| 2015-03-31 10:52:47
videos| mantism| Alright, here's some context.  Singapore originated from a lot of immigrants coming from other countries to find another life. The mix of many different races and religions (Chinese from Mainland China, Malays from Malaysia and Indonesia etc, Indians from India, etc etc) caused a lot of problems for Lee Kuan Yew when he was trying to unify the country and achieve independence from the British colonial masters.   After a fairly difficult period of doing so, LKY succeeded. Then, he tried to form a merger with Malaysia to form a singular nation - he had believed all his life for the merging of Malaysia and Singapore because they share many common grounds. However, the difference in politics (Malaysia's UMNO = favours Malays over everyone else, Singapore's PAP = all races have equal rights) causes strains in relations, which when coupled with a huge racial riot, caused Singapore to be kicked out of any kind of merger.  This is where it gets interesting - LKY managed to make Singapore so successful with so little resources **he gets a pretty much 'god-like figure' about him**. Thing is, this 'god-like figure' isn't literal to us Singaporeans (not the North Korean level), but **he gains a lot of respect**. Most Singaporeans takes pride in LKY's ability to turn Singapore into a first-world country in two or three generations, and also how he is respected by other world leaders around the globe.  **Now about Amos Yee**, the dude in the video. Amos Yee has got into trouble before but not on such scale - he was criticizing the point of Chinese New Year and was on the verge of stirring up social tensions. Remember when Singapore is based on the very ideas of racial equality? Chinese New Year is a big part of Chinese, so Amos Yee was treading a very thin line here. The government is ready to eradicate any threat towards the racial equality that is over here - and typically they have the 'end justifies means' attitude towards things like this.  Now he's here. He has picked one of the worst times to make this video, because the entire nation was still mourning Lee Kuan Yew. Also, many citizens has gone out of the way to report the guy and give him death threats - it's only after a few days that this guy actually got arrested.  Now, several misconceptions you guys may have:  * Amos Yee was arrested partly because he spoke out against LKY, yes. However, many, many people have done so against LKY and his political party, the PAP, but they don't pick such a time and use the same amount of vulgarities when none is needed.  * Freedom of speech do exist. I mean, I'm on the darn internet right now, that's one. But the sedition law allows the government to arrest those that are trying to ignite tensions. I'm not going to justify this, but maybe from their point of view, Amos Yee is trying to ignite tensions. Remember, we had a very fragile racial equality before. Gov't would go arms up trying to defend this.  * (not very related) Contrary to popular belief, we can chew gum. You can even do it right in front of a police officer and they won't give a shit. You just can't market it without a license or litter.  I'm kind of rushed for time, so I will continue this later if needed.| 2| 2015-03-31 10:29:42

worldnews| ball-satchel| The thing is Amos Yee posted his video publicly on Youtube for all of Singapore and the whole world to see. The Singapore Police never mentioned his name, but only said that they arrested "a 16-year-old male Singaporean". It's pretty easy for the public to then connected the dots.| 3| 2015-03-31 06:07:03
worldnews| veils1de| to everyone who thinks this kid is hilarious and heroic, you all should really look further into who he is. he's a head case looking for attention with some serious misplaced anger issues. he tweets shit like "i'm making fun of suicidal people" and "never resort to violence except for self defence and sex". arresting him isn't going to do much good, but neither is flippantly praising him for being "ballsy" because he posted an offensive video. if you can't make an argument without lobbing insults and hyperbole (as in amos yee), you've got a problem| 14| 2015-03-31 04:48:45
worldpolitics| fishwer| Many of the comments here clearly do not understand the underlying issues behind this incident. Singapore has a history of imprisoning dissenters and deemed "posing a threat to our stability". I would suggest reading up abouy past political prisoners like Chia Thye Poh ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chia_Thye_Poh ) and Dr Lim Hock Siew to get some understanding.    What Amos Yee has done is widely understood as suicide in Singapore and I think he knows that too. this doesnt make his punishment justified but does show the traits he possessed for publishing the video. What he has done will definitely become a talking point in the local news and I hope will open discussion about the whole affair (hopefully with proper discourse)| 5| 2015-03-31 02:52:04

singapore| condor_gyros| And who gets to determine what is or isn't downright pointless or offensive? I'd say there is an illusion of "sufficient" freedom of speech in Singapore because most of the casual racism goes unpunished. The truth is that is probably due to the lack of reports of such incidents. If people actually reported cases of casual racism whenever they occur, just like the reports made on Amos Yee, you can bet there'd be arrests left and right. If the Sedition Act is not enforced swiftly, then it just becomes farcical and people begin to feel that the rules can be bent.| 1| 2015-03-31 01:30:36

singapore| NO_LAH_WHERE_GOT| When I was about 20 years old I wrote a blogpost titled "How To Save Singapore". It was narcissistic, messianic, selfish, normative.   I thought I knew what was best for the country, based on my insightful observations and superior knowledge. Clearly, everybody around me was misled and misunderstood, and it would be practically IMMORAL for me to remain silent. I had to let everybody know what they were doing wrong. Surely, when they saw it, they would realize the errors of their ways and we would see harmony and flourishing in Singapore!  You can imagine how it went down. A whole bunch of people (including some close friends) tore me a new asshole. I got emails telling me to quit writing, to honour Singapore by killing myself, etc, etc. It was a profound "holy shit, I am a part of the problem" moment for me. (And also a realization that people can be really, really mean and hurtful when you get it wrong. There is no sympathy for people who make mistakes publicly.)  I've sinced mellowed down and realized that things are far more complex than I had previously realized, and that people aren't interested in being talked down to, or in hearing their values and ideals being insulted. I realized I was incredibly stupid and ignorant in many ways.  Despite it all, I still kept writing– because I realize underneath all the anger and venom and arrogance, I spoke up because I cared. And I still cared. Nobody taught me how to do it properly– most people just DIDN'T care, which I found offensive at the time.  I see a lot of myself in a kid like Amos Yee. I was never as angry or vitriolic, but my experiences never got that bad. But I have hope that he'll learn from this incident and reflect upon himself. He might just get around to making some wonderful contributions. He just needs to learn some tact, grace, humility... things that aren't too intuitive for a 17 year old.  Give him a chance to redeem himself. He might surprise you.| 15| 2015-03-30 23:37:38
singapore| yesiamherfriend| As I've mentioned [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/30pv1p/amos_yee_youtuber_who_described_mr_lees_death_as/cpv8r1b) in the other thread about Amos Yee, I think the problem is with the general misunderstanding of "Freedom of Speech".  &gt; As for this "freedom of speech" that everyone talks about: in the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, under article 19:  &gt; 1) Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.  &gt; 2) Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.  &gt; 3) The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary:  &gt; (a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;  &gt; (b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals.  &gt; Read pt 3a, and 3b. While he has definitely exercised his right to freedom of expression, I don't think he carried the responsibility of respecting the right and reputation of others, or cared about the protection of national security and of public order.  &gt; The whole "Singapore lacks freedom of speech" thing is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of "freedom of speech". You can hold whatever opinions you want, but you don't sprout off all sorts of hate that infringes on the opinions of others.  &gt; This sounds like Singapore to me. Be moderate, be balanced, and criticise with facts. I know I prefer it to America's hyper-liberal media, where anyone can talk crap and spin bullshit with quarter truths to preach to the mindless sheeple.  An easy example would be the Charlie Hebdo incident. Freedom of Speech comes with responsibilities; when you deliberately make fun of the religious leader of **23.4% of the world's population**, is it any wonder that there is 2 crazy fuckers in the mix? I'm not condoning the actions of the two nut-bags, I'm just stating the very obvious. 2 out of 1 600 000 000 is 0.00000000125%. I'm amazed that they didn't gather more people to head down there.   I'm not a big fan of government censorship, but I believe in self-censorship. Unfortunately, when you have 5.4 million people, the only way you can make sure people don't end up going at each others' throats is really systematic censorship.| 5| 2015-03-30 17:36:45

singapore| Betadyne| I think it may depend more on outside events. Singapore has never been one to jump to the forefront of social change. I think we're waiting for an Asian country to begin legalising homosexuality, watch how they implement it, before making a better version.  While I agree with you on the Amos Yee thing, I have to add that our government has always had a nip-it-in-the-bud policy with respect to agitating social conflict. Amos Yee is being made an example of. I don't like it, but I can't argue with its effectiveness.| 4| 2015-03-30 14:45:28

singapore| spvn| freedom to speech has NEVER meant "you can say whatever the hell you want". This exceedingly common misconception is really frustrating. You're only allowed to voice opinions that do not infringe on the reputations and rights of others.  From the UNDHR  &gt; 3) The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary: &gt;  &gt; (a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others; &gt;  &gt; (b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals.  There have always been limitations on the freedom to speech, because if everyone was allowed to say anything they wanted, we'd have a lot of bigger societal problems on our hands. In the case of Amos Yee, he insulted both the late PM (who's obviously a major political figure and sort of a symbol for the nation as a whole) as well as an entire religion (which is a very very sensitive topic for many people and should not be taken lightly).| 10| 2015-03-30 13:41:08
singapore| yesiamherfriend| OP here: I apologise in advance for not finding a more "permanent" link. I did not expect Channel 8 news to delete their tweet. Here's another [link](http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/courts-crime/story/police-arrest-amos-yee-the-teen-behind-anti-lee-kuan-yew-video-201).  As a politically moderate person, I'm not sure how I feel about his arrest.   On one hand, the impression I get from him is that he has such an inflated sense of self worth. I've actually gone through a few of his videos because I want to get a more thorough understanding of him as a person and what I got out of it is a 17 year old who thinks he's god damn intelligent while sprouting lots of rhetoric based on his amazingly limited life experiences and severely myopic point of view. Basically, the folly of youth. He raised one or two valid points about LKY, but did so in such a completely arrogant tone that it is impossible to sympathise with him. Don't believe me, just go watch his video titled "Philosophy of Amos Yee" and "Lost Love". When I finished those, I couldn't decide if he was just putting on an act or if he's seriously so full of himself. In the end I decided he's either a great actor, or a complete moron.  On the other hand, arresting him seems like an over-reaction from the SPF, and he is most definitely going to come out of this with a martyr complex. This arrest will be politicised by the nutters in TRS, even as the police is probably acting out not under a political influence. A precedence exists at this point, and so the SPF's hands are tied, but it would still be made out as "big bad gahmen bullying young boy". I think a good criticism should be one that is moderate, balanced, and supported with facts. I don't think Amos Yee's criticism is moderate, balanced, or supported with facts. Does he deserve to be arrested? I'm not sure. I think he needs a really tough wake up call. But I'm not sure if it should come from the government.  As for this "freedom of speech" that everyone talks about: in the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, under article 19:   &gt; 1) Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference. &gt;  &gt; 2) Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice. &gt;  &gt; 3) The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it special duties and responsibilities.

[Source](http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx)  Read pt 3a, and 3b.

singapore| Ydoyoucare| Um, [Edz Ello lied about the hacking and he was sacked by TTSH.](http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/more-singapore-stories/story/tan-tock-seng-fires-filipino-nurse-who-made-offensive-co) He even issued death threats to Singaporeans.  Amos Yee made seditious comments about LKY and Christianity. To me, it looks as though Edz Ello's crime is more seditious and threatening than Amos's because Edz Ello issued death threats. However, I agree that both are seditious in nature and should be punished. In spite of that, Amos got a heavier punishment instead of the same or lighter punishment. Plus, Amos is also only 17 whereas Edz Ello is clearly an adult in the eyes of the law.  I could give you better examples but I feel that googling will take some time and I dont feel like digging through results after results to prove a point. This recent case is the best example I can think of because it is happening right now.  You dont have to accept my point but from now on, just be aware of crimes and the nationalities of the perpertrators, and if it helps, subscribe to TRS or TRE (not for their content obviously) or even Yahoo News on facebook and read the comments of people who have read articles on them. I normally tend to go "Oh yeah, I forgot about so and so. What happened to it/them/he/she?" In this case, when Amos Yee was arrested, I thought nothing of it til I was reminded by our fellow Singaporeans, that he was only fired and not even arrested. Strange how Amos Yee's arrest was within days but til today, Edz Ello is still not arrested.| 1| 2015-03-30 11:24:38
singapore| FinnSolomon| It's likely that he wasn't arrested for the insult to LKY, or the photo, but his remarks about Christianity.  You might believe in absolute freedom of speech, but even in American and European societies there are exceptions made for hate speech and so on. In Singapore, where the population places a very high importance on religion, ANY remarks made that might threaten the stability of the country has to be at least investigated. It's impt to note that he hasn't actually been punished yet.  I think the main difference in your views can be encapsulated in LKY's mantra - Be correct, not politically correct. It is of course wonderful to aim for freedom of speech, people can say what they like and the only consequence is a negative judgment. But we have experienced terrible racial riots in our history that happened when religions were insulted. Does that seem primitive to an atheist Westerner? Probably. Does it mean it's the best thing for Singapore? Not right now. We deal with the world as it is, not how we like it to be.  TLDR - Amos Yee is being investigated for insulting a religion, which has resulted in racial riots in the past, Singapore decides to infringe upon Amos's freedom to ensure the safety of others.| 16| 2015-03-30 10:55:14

singapore| ball-satchel| I agree the banning of books with homosexuality is concerning, but part of me thinks that this is just a hallmark of an older generation with more conservative social values. I think Singapore will become more progressive with time as the younger generations take on positions of leadership.  On the issue of Amos Yee I'm a bit conflicted. On one hand, I think that charging him for sedition is overdoing it a bit. It is quite clear that nobody takes him seriously, and he isn't going to lead any national movements against christians or the PAP anytime soon, so the risk of him harming society is quite low. But on the other hand, he is an asshole and I kinda want to see him get fucked by the justice system. | 12| 2015-03-30 10:46:44
singapore| runningman_ssi| That's like Newton not coming up with the theory for gravity because it's obvious that apples fall to the ground hence gravity. While there are examples, most of the news details among different cases seem vague enough that one can't be sure that they are one and same according to the written laws. Has anyone ever compared different cases, research our laws and realise that foreigners are being sentenced lighter than Singaporeans?   For one, Edz Ello claimed his account was hacked and the police are still investigating. I'm not sure how recent this is, but this was the latest known news in Google. I'm not too sure about the charges for Amos Yee, although I'm sure he's not as retarded as that Roy guy. He is at least smart enough to take down his video and blog post.   Are you sure it's really that obvious? Can you cite me some really good examples that leaves no doubts that both foreigner and local committed the exact same type of crime (as listed under our laws), but the foreigner always get off lighter than the local, given similar factors? If it's that obvious, there must be tons of examples as you said. I don't really follow much of these. | 2| 2015-03-30 10:44:54
singapore| Ydoyoucare| This one obviously doesnt require a source because you can find a lot of examples.  The most recent case would be comparing Amos Yee to Edz Ello. One got arrested, the other just got fired. Both did seditious crimes, both stirred a lot of hate and both did not apologize.  There are many others. Just pay attention to when foreigners commit crimes and then compare with Singaporeans who commit the same crimes.| 1| 2015-03-30 09:31:32
